			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The<em> Magistrates Cases</em> began in 1969 under the then Chief Stipendiary Magistrate Mr Bill Cuthill. Relevant judgments of the Supreme Court of Victoria were sent to Mr Cuthill who then arranged for them to be copied and distributed to all serving Magistrates in Victoria. These <em>Cases</em> were not edited.</font></strong><a href="signup.php?action=add"></a></p>
			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">In the 1970s, responsibility for the distribution of the <em>Cases</em> was taken on by Stipendiary Magistrates John Wallace and Kevin Burgess (later DCSM). Most of the<em> Cases</em> were edited in some form and an Annual Index prepared and distributed to the Magistrates.</font></strong></p>
			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">In 1983 the present Editor Stipendiary Magistrate Patrick Street (later DCM) began to edit the <em>Cases</em> and produced them in a compact readable format, generally ten Parts per year plus a comprehensive Index. This format has continued to the present date which means that Mr Street has been editing the <em>Cases</em> continuously for the past 30 years.</font></strong></p>
			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">Since 1969 the Magistrates' Court has been responsible for the publication and distribution of the <em>Cases</em>. However, in 1995, the Law Institute of Victoria took over the publication of the <em>Cases</em>. The then LIV President Mark Woods approached Mr Street with the suggestion that the <em>Cases</em> be generally available to practitioners as a booklet distributed with the <em>LIV Journal</em>. Mr Woods said: &quot;Recognising that this is the court in which most Victorians litigate, the Institute has been concerned to devise a scheme by which members of the LIV have the opportunity of receiving this resource at the same time that magistrates do.&quot;</font></strong></p>
			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">This arrangement with the LIV continued until 1998 when the Magistrates' Court resumed publication and distribution of the <em>Cases</em>.</font></strong></p>
			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The Present:<br>
						The <em>Cases</em> are now available by subscription via <em>magistratescases.com.au</em>. This service is supervised and guaranteed by the present Editor Patrick Street. Parts 1-11 of 2013 have now been published and Part 12 is in preparation. In relation to past issues, the Cases back to 1969 have now been uploaded to the database and the Cases are currently available in annual bound volumes. In addition, subscribers have online access to almost 2,400 <em>Cases </em>and<em> Case Notes </em></font></strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><strong>ranging from the 1960s to the present</strong></font><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">.</font></strong></p>
			<p><strong><font face="Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif">The full set of the <em>Magistrates Cases</em> is an invaluable legal resource for any person who is connected with or practises in the Magistrates' Court of Victoria.</font></strong></p>
