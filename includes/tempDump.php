The apparent cause of death was hanging. In 2004, W. participated in a video taped record of interview in which he stated he had killed his father by strangulation with a short piece of rope. W. gave an apparently detailed and circumstantial account of his reasons for doing so, the manner of the strangulation and the faking of the hanging. Also, there were other antecedent statements concerning an acrimonious exchange of SMS messages between W. and his children on the evening preceding his record of interview. In the course of this exchange W. was in effect challenged to prove that he killed his father as an element of demonstrating honesty in statements made in the context of his relationship with his own children. W. was charged with the murder of his father and at the trial, the record of interview was challenged on the grounds of involuntariness, unreliability and unfairness.<br /><strong>HELD: Record of interview not excluded from evidence.<br />1.&nbsp;Whilst the record of interview may have been provoked by the exchange of text messages which occurred between W. and his children, this was not a case of basal involuntariness. W. was not compelled to confess. He elected to go to police to make statements which he knew might be used in evidence against him. There was no evidence that W.s will was at that time overborne in the fundamental sense required to demonstrate the record of interview was involuntary.<br />2.&nbsp;Insofar as unreliability is concerned, if it could be positively demonstrated that the unreliability of the record of interview was such that W. would not receive a fair trial if the record of interview were admitted in evidence, then it should in the courts discretion be excluded from evidence. Unreliability of evidence is a matter of degree. If unreliability of itself does not justify exclusion of a confession, it may still be relevant to consideration of the discretion arising by reason of other factors such as evidence tainted by unfairness or procedural impropriety. As there were no such questions arising in the present case, the question was whether the record of interview could be demonstrated to be so unreliable as to justify exclusion on that ground alone.<br />3.&nbsp;Even if the confessional evidence was admissible, the intellectual or mental state of the accused may go to the exercise of a discretion to reject the evidence. It may touch upon the propriety of the means by which the confessional statement was obtained, the reliability of the statement itself and the fairness involved in permitting the statement to be used against the accused. In the present case, having regard to the medical evidence and the other evidence concerning the circumstances of the death, the confessional statement was one of possible unreliability but not of inherently unreliability.<br />4.&nbsp;The record of interview was conducted openly, fairly and with all necessary cautions. The confessions were both confirmed and elaborated freely after W. was fully cautioned and when he knew precisely what the consequences of such a confession were likely to be. Accordingly, there were no circumstances which justified the conclusion that the admission of the confession into evidence would result in unfairness to W.<br />&nbsp;<br />OSBORN J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;On 16 February 1996 the body of Edward Waters was found at his home in Jeparit. The apparent cause of death was hanging. The body was slumped partially over the rear steps to the house with a noose around the neck accompanied by clear evidence of compression injury to the neck.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;It appeared that the rope above the noose had broken from one of two ends of a rope tied and knotted carefully around a beam above.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Subsequently a coroner returned a finding without inquest that the deceased had died as a result of asphyxia by hanging and no other person contributed to the death. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;On 3 August 2004 the accused participated in a video taped record of interview in which he stated that he had killed the deceased his father, by strangulation with a short piece of rope. He gave an apparently detailed and circumstantial account of his reasons for doing so, the manner of the strangulation and the faking of the hanging. At the conclusion of this interview the accused was charged with the murder of the deceased.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Kennan and Mr Laschko now make preliminary application to have the record of interview together with certain antecedent confessional statements excluded from evidence upon the trial. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The application with respect to the antecedent statements is provisional in the sense that it is put as part of a global objection. If the record of interview is not excluded from evidence the accused’s representatives would wish to consider whether the antecedent statements should remain the subject of continuing objection, because they may be necessary to the defence case in order to put forward an explanation by reference to the sequence of events which triggered the record of interview. In particular the antecedent statements include components of an acrimonious exchange of SMS messages between the accused and his children on the evening preceding his record of interview. In the course of this exchange he was in effect challenged to prove he killed his father as an element of demonstrating honesty in statements made in the context of his relationship with his own children. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The record of interview is challenged on the grounds of involuntariness, unreliability and unfairness. <br />Involuntariness <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;In my view it cannot be said to have been involuntary. It may have been provoked by the exchange of text messages which occurred between the accused and his children, but this is not a case of basal involuntariness such as <em>The Queen v S L</em>[1]. The accused was not compelled to confess. He was challenged as to his truthfulness and elected to go to the police to make statements which he knew might be used in evidence against him. No evidence was called from the accused himself on the voir dire as to his state of mind at the time of the record of interview and there is no evidence that the accused’s will was at that time overborne in the fundamental sense required to demonstrate the record of interview was involuntary[2]. <br /><strong>Unreliability </strong><br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Insofar as unreliability and unfairness are concerned, I accept that if it can be positively demonstrated that the unreliability of a record of interview is such that the accused would not receive a fair trial if the record of interview were admitted in evidence, then it should in the court’s discretion be excluded from evidence. It is fundamental to our system of justice that a person should not be convicted of an offence save after a fair trial according to law[3]. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Nevertheless a distinction must be drawn between cases where the record of interview is inherently or intrinsically unreliable, and cases where the relative degree of its reliability is only capable of assessment by reference to extrinsic factors including circumstantial evidence as to the effect of which views might legitimately differ. The common law has always permitted potentially unreliable evidence to go to juries subject to appropriate directions and warnings as to its use. As the Full Court stated in <em>Rozenes v Beljajev</em>[4]:<br />"Unreliability means what has been described by the High Court as potential unreliability on a number of occasions in considering whether the position of a witness required that a warning about corroboration, or some similar warning, be given. ... <br />Unreliability of evidence is a matter of degree: almost all evidence is, we suppose, unreliable in the sense that there is a risk or probability that it will not be accurate in every respect. The expression is used in the cases dealing with warnings to be given to juries to convey that the evidence in question is unreliable to what might be called an uncommon degree."<br />Further, it has been accepted that it could only be in "a most exceptional case"[5] that one could say, as Vincent J put it in <em>R v Peirce</em>[6] that the considerations affecting reliability were not "comprehensible to a jury and capable of assessment by them as the proper tribunal of fact."<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;This Court has in recent times on a number of occasions been required to apply the principles stated by the High Court in the cases of <em>R v Swaffield, R v Pavic</em>[7], to circumstances in which confessional statements have been elicited by police under cover operatives and covertly taped. As the joint judgment of Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ stated[8]:<br />"As the authorities stand, the likelihood of an unreliable confession does not mandate the exercise of the unfairness discretion to exclude that evidence. Nevertheless, it is hard to understand why, in such circumstances, the discretion would not be exercised in that way, particularly when regard is had to the consideration that the risk of an untrue admission is the rationale for the inadmissibility of a non-voluntary confessional statement."<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Ultimately, their Honours together with Kirby J adopted the view that the admissibility of confessional material turns first on the question of voluntariness, next an exclusion based on considerations of reliability, and finally on a overall discretion taking account of all the circumstances (including the means by which any admission was elicited and whether unfair forensic disadvantage may be occasioned by the admission of the evidence), to determine whether the admission of the evidence would come at an unacceptable price having regard to contemporary community standards.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The first question involves consideration of a mandatory precondition to admissibility. The discretionary considerations then referred to may be sufficient in themselves or may overlap. Thus unreliability itself may justify exclusion of a confession in some cases, but if it does not, it may still be relevant to consideration of the discretion otherwise arising by reason of other factors. Thus potential (as distinct from demonstrable) unreliability may not justify exclusion of evidence in itself but it may be a significant factor favouring the exclusion of evidence otherwise tainted by unfairness or procedural impropriety. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In the present case no question of procedural impropriety arises with respect to the record of interview and for reasons to which I shall return I am satisfied it is not tainted by unfairness. It follows that unlike some cases involving covertly taped confessions, the critical question in this case is simply whether the record of interview can be demonstrated to be so unreliable as to justify exclusion on that ground alone. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;In both <em>R v Favata</em>[9] and <em>R v Clarke</em>[10], Teague and Kellam JJ respectively, when considering covertly taped confessions, made reference to that line of authority which holds that evidence of mental disorder may lead to the conclusion that a confession is so inherently unreliable that it should not be admitted. In <em>Pfitzner v R</em>[11] Doyle CJ after a consideration of the relevant authorities and in particular the judgment of the High Court in <em>Sinclair v R</em>[12] posed the relevant test as being "based upon affirmative satisfaction that the admissions are inherently unreliable as distinct from possibly unreliable".<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;This test accords with that adopted by the Full Court in <em>R v Starecki</em>[13] namely whether the evidence showed the accused was suffering from such unbalance of mind that no account should be taken of what he said. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;In my view this test is appropriate where the sole or essential ground upon which exclusion of a confessional statement is sought is that of unreliability. As I have said it may be however that potential unreliability will be a relevant discretionary consideration when coupled with other matters. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;It is desirable to refer more fully in the present case to the principles forming the background to the test stated in <em>Pfitzner</em>[14], because of the significance sought to be attributed in this case to the mental state of the accused. The underlying principles were summarised by Gleeson CJ in <em>R v Parker</em>[15]:<br />"Cases in which a Crown case depends, wholly or substantially, upon confessions alleged to have been made by an accused person who is suffering from some form of mental disability, whether such cases are proceeding as ordinary criminal trials or pursuant to the special procedures contained in Pt XIA of the <em>Crimes Act</em>, present obvious difficulties. The principles relevant to the resolution of those difficulties may be summarised as follows:<br /><strong>1.</strong> The fact that an accused person who has allegedly confessed to committing a crime was, at the time of the alleged confession, suffering from some form of unsoundness of mind or psychiatric disorder may, depending upon the circumstances, be of importance in considering the evidentiary value of the confession, and may in some circumstances deprive it of all evidentiary value.[16] It does not, however, necessarily make evidence of the confession inadmissible.[17] As Dixon J observed in <em>Sinclair</em>, an insane person is not necessarily an incompetent witness. Persons who are intellectually handicapped or who suffer from disease or disorder of the mind are by no means necessarily incapable of telling, or admitting, the truth.<br /><strong>2.</strong> Even if such evidence is admissible, a consideration of the quality of the evidence may, in a given case, result in a conclusion that a verdict founded upon it is unsafe and unsatisfactory.[18]<br /><strong>3.</strong> The intellectual capacity of the accused, or the existence of some disease or disorder of the mind, may go to the issue of whether the confession was voluntary and may in that respect bear upon the admissibility of the evidence. It may be relevant to the question whether the confession was made in the exercise of free choice, as for example, where an accused is incapable of making such a free choice, or of understanding his right to choose between speaking and remaining silent. Depending upon the circumstances, it may have an important bearing upon whether the statement was made as the result of duress, intimidation or undue insistence or pressure. The circumstances in which such a fact may be relevant to an issue as to the voluntariness of a confession are multifarious.[19]<br /><strong>4.</strong> Further, even if the confessional evidence is admissible, the intellectual or mental state of the accused may, in a number of possible ways, go to the exercise of a trial judges discretion to reject the evidence.[20] It may, for example, touch upon the propriety of the means by which the confessional statement was obtained, the reliability of the statement itself, and the fairness involved in permitting the statement to be used against the accused.<br /><strong>5.</strong> A persons vocabulary and standard of comprehension may also be of relevance in determining an issue as to whether such a person in fact made or intended the admissions attributed to him.[21]<br /><strong>6.</strong> If a Crown case is based in whole or in part upon the confession of a person suffering from some mental disability which may affect the reliability of the confession then a trial judge in his summing-up should use appropriate means to bring to the attention of the jury the possible danger of basing a conviction on such evidence unless it is confirmed by other evidence.[22]"<br />(Citations taken to foot, my emphasis.)<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of the accused that I should be satisfied in terms of the test stated in <em>Pfitzner</em>[23] that the admissions in the record of interview were inherently unreliable as distinct from possibly unreliable. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;I have come to the view that the present case is one of possible unreliability not of inherent unreliability and that the matters which go to a final determination of the reliability of the alleged confessions are matters properly left to the jury to determine. My reasons for this conclusion are as follows.<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;The application is made on the basis of evidence:<br />(a) as to the probable state of mind of the accused at the time of the alleged confession; and <br />(b) as to the consistency of the account given by him in his record of interview with the "external" circumstantial evidence— <br />• concerning the circumstances of the killing generally; <br />• concerning the condition of the body after death; and <br />• concerning the circumstances indicative of a hanging.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;As to the first matter namely the state of mind of the accused at the time of the alleged confessional statements, evidence was called from Dr Walton a psychiatrist, to the effect that at the time of the deceased’s death the accused suffered from chronic depression, produced in large part by a history of severe sexual abuse inflicted by the deceased upon both the accused and his siblings as children. This depression had in turn been aggravated by alcohol abuse, the break down of the accused’s first marriage, the breakdown of the relationship with his children by that marriage, and injuries suffered by him in a car accident. The stress caused by his depression was ultimately further aggravated by the acrimonious exchange with his children immediately prior to the making of the confessional statements.<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Dr Walton is of the view that the accused’s depression induced feelings of guilt and self loathing to such a degree that he felt compelled to confess to a killing for which he was not in fact responsible. Dr Walton says further that it is common for victims of sexual abuse to feel guilt and blame themselves for what occurred, to be confused as to their identity, to suffer from low self esteem and depression, and to engage in alcohol abuse and self destructive behaviour. It follows that the accused was one of a class of victims known to suffer from precisely the type of psychological difficulties which Dr Walton attributes to him.<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Dr Walton’s evidence is not that the accused was at the time of his record of interview incapable of making true confessional statements, but rather that there is substantial reason to believe the statements were untrue. It is not enough as was submitted to me that Dr Walton says there is a distinct possibility of the accused inventing the confession as a result of this mental condition. Such evidence shows that it is potentially not inherently unreliable.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;Further, the opinion of Dr Walton was not supported by direct evidence from the accused as to his state of mind at the time of the record of interview. It will ultimately fall to the jury to assess his state of mind having regard among other things to the evidence available to them as to his history; the whole of the circumstantial evidence as to the circumstances of the deceased’s death; the subsequent history of the accused’s actions over the years following the deceased’s death; and the manner and nature of the confession available to them to view on video tape. <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;I turn then to the evidence as to the general circumstances of the killing. It is submitted firstly that the record of interview contains assertions of particular fact which are inconsistent with the objective circumstantial evidence relating to the circumstances in which the deceased died. It is submitted next that the balance of medical opinion favours the view that the deceased died by hanging and not by strangulation in the manner described in the record of interview. It is then further submitted that the balance of the engineering evidence supports the conclusion that the accused did not attempt to hang the deceased up in the manner described by him in the record of interview.[24] <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;It is submitted that the record of interview is directly inconsistent with objective circumstances in a number of instances including:<br />• the manner in which the rope at the scene was found to have been tied to the beam rather than looped over it as illustrated by the accused during the course of the record of interview; <br />• the time at which the accused initially states the killing occurred namely 9.00 am when it is apparent death occurred in the late afternoon; <br />• the denial by the accused to police officers that he had a psychiatric history; <br />• the demonstration of a length of rope used in the strangling, which would be insufficient; <br />• description of a blue and yellow telecom rope as the rope used in the hanging, when the rope used in the hanging was orange; <br />• differing versions of where the rope was obtained; <br />• failure to explain without prompting why the accused went out to get cigarettes for his father after his father’s death.<br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;Conversely, Ms Williams submits that the record of interview contains reference to a number of significant matters that confirm the Crown case including matters that only the killer would know:<br />• the existence of a powerful motive to kill triggered ultimately by particular statements of the deceased; <br />• the deceased did not struggle when strangled; <br />• the deceased was dragged to the back verandah on a chair in a manner demonstrated on the videotape;<br />• there was a need to fit the hangmans noose to the preexisting strangulation mark; • the rope used in the attempted hanging appeared too long after the event.<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;The contentions of both the Crown and the defence fall to be assessed against an account given eight years after the events in issue, by a man whose memory may be less than perfect for that reason alone. These and other circumstances will ultimately be addressed in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in the following much cited passage from the judgment of Gibb CJ and Mason J in <em>Chamberlain v R (No 2)</em>[25]&nbsp;<br />"We have no doubt that the position is correctly stated in the following passage in <em>R v Beble</em>[26] that: It is not the law that a jury should examine separately each item of evidence adduced by the prosecution, apply the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt as to that evidence and reject if they are not so satisfied. At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence may support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment; they should consider the accumulation of the evidence[27].<br />Similarly, in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it. It is well established that the jury must consider the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together[28]. In <em>Plomp v R</em>[29], it was argued that the motives of the accused could not be considered until it was shown by evidence that in some physical way his actions were responsible for his wifes death. The court rejected this argument. Dixon CJ said[30]:<br />All the circumstances of the case must be weighed in judging whether there is evidence upon which a jury may reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the commission of the crime charged. There may be many cases where it is extremely dangerous to rely heavily on the existence of a motive, where an unexplained death or disappearance of a person is not otherwise proved to be attributable to the accused; but all such considerations must be dealt with on the facts of the particular case. I cannot think, however, that in a case where the prosecution is based on circumstantial evidence any part of the circumstances can be put on one side as relating to motive only, and therefore not to be weighed as part of the proofs of what was done.<br />It follows from what we have said that the jury should decide whether they accept the evidence of a particular fact, not by considering the evidence directly relating to that fact in isolation, but in the light of the whole evidence, and that they can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference. Nevertheless the jury cannot view a fact as a basis for an inference of guilt unless at the end of the day they are satisfied of the existence of that fact beyond reasonable doubt. When the evidence is circumstantial, the jury, whether in a civil or in a criminal case, are required to draw an inference from the circumstances of the case; in a civil case the circumstances must raise a more probable inference in favour of what is alleged, and in a criminal case the circumstances must exclude any reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence ..." <br />(Citations taken to foot.)<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;It is further to be observed that as juries are routinely instructed, it is not for the Crown to prove every detail of what happened leading up to, at or about the time of and after the deceased’s death. The Crown must prove the criminal elements of the accuseds conduct and critically in this case that the accused caused the deceased’s death. The evidence of circumstances surrounding the alleged killing may bear directly on the credibility of the accused’s confession as part of a record of interview which is otherwise shown to be untrustworthy but they can do no more than this. The weight that might be given to allegedly critical consistencies or inconsistencies between the record of interview and items of objective circumstantial evidence is a matter for the jury as the tribunal of fact.<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;I turn then to the evidence of Drs. Lynch, Langdren and Gall. In my view their evidence cannot be regarded (either on its own or taken with other matters) as justifying the conclusion that the critical confessional statements are unreliable. Nor is their evidence materially supplemented by the original opinions reached by Dr. Bourke and Dr. Humphries post mortem.<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;None of the medical witnesses say that the now available evidence as to the state of the deceased’s body after death, justifies the conclusion that he could not have been strangled in the manner described by the accused. Both Dr. Langdren and Dr. Gall identify matters which tend to favour on the balance of probabilities the hypothesis that the deceased died as a result of hanging. Nevertheless each of the factors identified may be said to be subject to relativities which were ventilated in cross examination and taken at their highest, they do no more than justify a conclusion based upon the medical part of the evidence only. As such they cannot be said to require a particular conclusion on the whole of the evidence as to the ultimate facts in issue.<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;Likewise the evidence of the local police officer as to lack of signs of struggling at the scene of death, of the informant as to rope lengths found at the scene, and of the engineers Professor Kuhnell, Dr. Field and Mr. Dohrmann, does not compel the view that the accused’s account of the killing and its aftermath is inherently unreliable.<br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;First the engineering experts set out to test the feasibility of actions hypothetically undertaken by the deceased but not directly witnessed on the one hand and of actions of the accused described in answers contained in the record of interview which are themselves open to debate as to their precise meaning. Both the scenarios tested are subject to some uncertainty.[31] <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, both Professor Kuhnell and Dr. Field put forward hypotheses which are consistent with the confessional statements made by the accused.<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;Thirdly, although there is substantial force in Mr. Kennan’s submission that the Crown cannot persuasively pick and choose aspects of the record of interview as being truthful, alleged inconsistencies between the accused’s account and the circumstances analysed by Mr. Dohrmann go ultimately to the weight to be given to the accused’s confession of murder by strangulation. They do not directly demonstrate that the alleged killing could not have occurred as admitted or otherwise invalidate the terms of the confession going to the manner of strangulation.<br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;Fourthly, the evidence as to the fake hanging scenario advanced in the record of interview which is criticised by Mr Dohrmann, is part only of the circumstantial evidence in the case, and must be assessed as part of the evidence as a whole in accordance with the principles stated in <em>Chamberlain (No. 2)</em> cited above. Investigative Unfairness <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;Lastly it is submitted that the manner in which the confession was provoked makes its reception into evidence unfair. I reject this submission. First the confessional statements relied on represent the culmination of a series of statements made over many years and commencing well before the final exchange of SMS messages between the accused and his children. Secondly, the confessions were both confirmed and elaborated freely and fully after the accused was cautioned and when he knew precisely what the consequences of such confession were likely to be. Thirdly once it is accepted for the reasons I have set out above that the confessional statements were voluntary and were not inherently unreliable; there are in my view no further circumstances which justify the conclusion that the admission of them into evidence would result in unfairness to the accused. The last of the SMS messages sent to the accused by his daughter Sarah was in terms suggested by a police officer[32], but they did no more than continue the terms of the prior exchange which included both the proposition "you killed grandad" and repeated admissions "I did kill Ted".<br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;The record of interview was conducted openly, fairly and with all necessary cautions. It is for the jury to determine whether ultimately the accused was provoked into a false confession or whether in fact he confessed to a killing of which he was guilty. <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;They will do so subject to the fundamental direction required by authorities such as <em>R v Green</em>[33], and such further warnings as the evidence may require.<br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;For the above reasons I am not prepared to exclude the record of interview from evidence.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] 2005 VSCA 292. <br />[2] <em>McDermott v The King</em> (1948) 76 CLR 501 per Dixon J at 511; and see <em>Collins v R </em>(1980) 31 ALR 257 per Brennan J (dissenting on the facts) at 307-308. <br />[3] <em>Rozenes v Beljajev </em>(1995) 1 VR 533 at 549; <em>Dietrich v R </em>(1992) 177 CLR 252 at 299-30 per Mason CJ and McHugh J, at 326 per Deane J and at 362 per Gaudron J. <br />[4] Above at 550 <br />[5] Above at 599 <br />[6] (1992) 1 VR 273 at 277 <br />[7] (1998) 192 CLR 159 <br />[8] Above at 197 [77] <br />[9] [2004] VSC 7 <br />[10] [2004] VSC 11 <br />[11] (1996) 85 A Crim R 120 <br />[12] (1946) 73 CLR 316 <br />[13] (1960) VR 141 at 152 <br />[14] above <br />[15] (1990) 19 NSWLR 177 at 183-4 <br />[16] <em>Jackson v The Queen </em>(1962) 108 CLR 591 <br />[17] <em>Sinclair v The King </em>(1946) 73 CLR 316 and <em>R v Starecki </em>[1960] VR 141 <br />[18] Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454 <br />[19] cf <em>R v Lee </em>(1950) 82 CLR 133 and <em>Van Der Meer v The Queen </em>(1988) 62 ALJR 656; 82 ALR 10. <br />[20] cf <em>McDermott v The King </em>(1948) 76 CLR 501; R v Lee. <br />[21] <em>Murphy v The Queen </em>(1989) 167 CLR 94 <br />[22] cf <em>Bromley v The Queen</em> (1986) 161 CLR 315 <br />[23] Above <br />[24] The argument shifted across the submissions but I have listed them in this order for convenience. <br />[25] 1984 153 CLR 521 at 535-6. <br />[26] [1979] Qd R 278 at 289 <br />[27] cf <em>Weeder v R </em>(1980) 71 Cr App R 228 at 231 <br />[28] per Lord Cairns, in <em>Belhaven and Stenton Peerage </em>(1875) 1 App Cas 278 at 279, cited in <em>R v Van Beelen </em>(1973) 4 SASR 353 at 373; and see <em>Thomas v R </em>[1972] NZLR 34–8 at 37 40, and cases there cited.<br />[29] (1963) 110 CLR 234 <br />[30] (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 242 <br />[31] eg.

B. was then required to accompany the officer to a police station for the purposes of a full breath test. B. left the scene and was later charged with a breach of s55(1) of the Road Safety Act 1986 (Act) in that "a requirement was made for him to accompany the member of the police force to a Police Station such requirement he did refuse to comply with." B. was convicted of the charge and appealed to the County Court. On the appeal, B.''s counsel said that the crux of the case was that the requirement to accompany was not made. The prosecution led evidence to say that it was and after B. closed his case, B.''s counsel submitted that there was no evidence that the instrument used for the PBT was a prescribed device. The judge allowed the prosecution to reopen its case to prove this point and B. was subsequently convicted of the charge. Upon application for review—<br />HELD: Application dismissed.<br />1. &nbsp;It was common ground that the offence charged was that of refusing to comply with a requirement to accompany a member of the police force to a police station for the purpose of furnishing a sample of breath for analysis, contrary to ss49(1)(e) and 55(1) of the Act. It is established that proof of the “requirement” under that section does not require proof of a formal demand in relation to each element. It is sufficient if a demand or requirement is made in substance and in comprehensible terms. However, the element to which B.''s counsel referred was not one which was necessary to proof of the charge and simply arose from inelegant drafting of the charge. The language used in the charge did not turn it into a different charge. There was surplus verbiage in the charge and it is not suggested that this was in any way misleading or prejudicial to B. Instead of the charge alleging that a requirement was made for B. to accompany a member of the police force to the police station for the purpose of furnishing a sample of breath for analysis, the charge alleged that the defendant was required to furnish a sample of breath for analysis [etc] and for that purpose such requirement was made. It was not a necessary part of the charge, nor was there any reason to think that it was so understood, that the member of the police force should have required the defendant to furnish a sample of breath for analysis at the time of requiring the defendant to accompany him to a police station.<br />2.&nbsp;The prosecution should be permitted to reopen its case only in special or exceptional circumstances. No lack of procedural fairness or any unfairness to the defence has been shown. In the circumstances described, and having regard to the explicit statements made by the defence about what were and were not issues, justice required that the prosecution be permitted to reopen its case in order to lead evidence as to a matter which it was reasonably entitled to assume was not in issue. There was no apparent prejudice or risk of prejudice to the defence in relation to this discrete issue which, in the forensic circumstances of this case, was a matter of formal proof only. No injustice was thereby done to B. <br />MANDIE J:<br />1.&nbsp; This proceeding arises out of events which occurred as long ago as 9 November 1998, in respect of which a charge was filed against the plaintiff (for convenience hereinafter referred to as “Mr Blair”) on 30 December 1998 to be heard in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Bendigo on 1 February 1999. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp; By originating motion, Mr Blair seeks judicial review of his conviction on 5 August 2004, by the County Court of Victoria sitting at Bendigo, of a charge brought against him by the second defendant herein (as informant) of an offence against s49(1)(e) of the Road Safety Act 1986. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp; There were two independent grounds for judicial review relied upon before this Court, to which I shall return, but in essence they are that the learned County Court Judge should not have convicted Mr Blair because the evidence did not support one essential element of the charge and that the learned County Court Judge should not have permitted the informant to reopen his case in order to permit him to prove another essential element of the charge. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp; The relevant offence was the refusal by Mr Blair to comply with a requirement pursuant to s55(1) of the Road Safety Act to accompany a member of the police force to a police station for the purpose of furnishing a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument under that section. Section 55(1) provides, so far as material: <br />“(1) If a person undergoes a preliminary breath test when required by a member of the police force ... to do so and— <br />(a) the test in the opinion of the member ... in whose presence it is made indicates that the person’s blood or breath contains alcohol ... <br />any member of the police force ... may require the person to furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument and for that purpose may further require the person to accompany a member of the police force ... to a place or vehicle where the sample of breath is to be furnished ”</p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp; Mr Blair was convicted in the following relevant circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp; The details of the charge contained in the charge and summons dated 30 December 1998 read as follows: <br />“The defendant at Charlton on 9/11/1998 being the driver of a motor vehicle and after having been required to have a preliminary breath test, he was then further required to furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument pursuant to Section 55(1) of the Road Safety Act 1986 and for that purpose a requirement was made for him to accompany a member of the police force to a Police Station such requirement he did refuse to comply with.”<br />7.&nbsp; It seems that the charge and summons was filed but subsequently lost or mislaid. It is not clear whether this circumstance caused any delay but what did happen was that on 13 October 2000 a Magistrate decided, notwithstanding a submission on behalf of Mr Blair that the Court had no jurisdiction due to the loss of the file or part thereof, that the Court had jurisdiction to hear the charge. The Magistrate then adjourned the proceeding to a date to be fixed due to a “defence request for further time”. However, Mr Blair then commenced a proceeding for judicial review in this Court which was dismissed by Pagone J on 19 June 2002.[1] Subsequently Mr Blair, who pleaded not guilty, was convicted of the charge in the Magistrates’ Court at Bendigo and it was ordered that his licence be cancelled and he was disqualified from driving in the State of Victoria for a period of 24 months effective from 28 May 2003 and was fined $600 plus statutory costs of $34. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp; By notice of appeal dated 30 July 2003 Mr Blair appealed to the County Court pursuant to s83(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. On 5 August 2004 the appeal (by way of rehearing of the charge) came on for hearing in the County Court of Victoria sitting at Bendigo. Mr Billings of Counsel appeared to defend the charge on behalf of Mr Blair. At the outset Counsel who then appeared for the informant suggested to the trial judge that they could perhaps find out what the issues were. After some discussion, Mr Billings said in substance that the crux of the case was that his client said that the requirement to accompany the policeman to the police station was not made whereas the police said that it was – “that’s really the issue”. After some further discussion the following exchange occurred: <br />“MR BILLINGS: There’s been a preliminary breath test. <br />HIS HONOUR: And then ---<br />MR BILLINGS: That’s not in issue.”</p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter the following further exchange occurred: <br />“HIS HONOUR: ... So he gets PBT’d and then disappears?<br />MR BILLINGS: Yes, that’s right. The issue is whether if he’s walked away, run away or whatever and taken up by an alien spaceship before the requirement is made he’s committed no offence.<br />HIS HONOUR: That may be so. So it’s all going to revolve around the interpretation of that section?<br />MR BILLINGS: Well, in one sense but it’s more simple than that. The requirement[2] ... if it hasn’t been made the charge has got to fail. ...<br />MR BILLINGS: Ultimately it’s really a question of fact for Your Honour, whether you’re satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the requirement was made. If you’re not then the appellant in my submission must win.”</p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp; Counsel for the informant, in the course of further discussion with the trial judge, indicated that the informant (who had not yet arrived at Court) would give evidence that, after the preliminary breath test was done, the informant said: <br />“In my opinion the test indicates that your blood contains alcohol. I now require you to accompany me to the police station for the purpose of a breath test and remain [t]here until you have furnished a sample of your breath and been given a certificate or until three hours (etc)”</p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp; Counsel for the informant said that the informant would then give evidence that the defendant did not respond and ran off into the rear of a house. Mr Billings then concurred with the trial judge that the defence case was “that wasn’t said”. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp; The discussion continued a little later when the following exchange occurred: <br />“HIS HONOUR: Yes. They can require him to have a PBT but that’s happened here, hasn’t it?<br />MR BILLINGS: Yes, it’s not in issue that he was found driving and a clinical test was given. <br />HIS HONOUR: So there’s been a PBT given. <br />MR BILLINGS: Yes.” </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp; The discussion continued and reference was made to DPP v Blyth[3]. Mr Billings conceded that the requirement did not have to be made in formal terms providing that it was made – “[t]he issue here is was it made, not in what terms it was made ... [s]o that providing a police member conveys in whatever language to a person that they’re required to accompany, formal or informal, that’s sufficient---”. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp; Eventually the informant (the second defendant in the present proceeding) arrived and gave evidence. After giving introductory evidence the informant testified as to the administration of a preliminary breath test and of the result and that he had then said to Mr Blair: <br />“In my opinion your blood contains alcohol. I now require you to accompany me to the police station for the purposes of a breath test and remain there until the test is complete and you have received a certificate or until three hours after the driving of a motor vehicle.”</p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp; The informant then gave evidence of Mr Blair’s flight from the scene. He was then cross-examined by Mr Billings about the order of events and as to various other matters affecting the informant’s version. Mr Billings in due course suggested to the informant that no requirement was made by him before Mr Blair left the scene and the informant said that that was not true. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp; A little later Mr Billings put to the informant that his evidence was that he did not make a requirement upon Mr Blair to furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument pursuant to s55(1) [of the Road Safety Act] to which the informant replied “That’s correct”. The following exchange then occurred: <br />“Q: You did not, after making such a requirement, require [Mr Blair] to accompany you for the purpose of undergoing that breath test which you’d required. Correct?<br />A: Well, I believe I did make the requirement to accompany as stated earlier.”</p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp; Counsel for the informant closed his case and Mr Billings made a no case submission which now forms the basis for his first ground for judicial review. Mr Billings submitted to the trial judge that there was no evidence to support an essential element of the offence contained in the charge. Mr Billings said: <br />“It’s a very simple submission, Your Honour. The charge and summons contains the particulars and the essential elements of the offence as alleged. It says that “At Charlton on 9 November 1998, the driver of a motor vehicle” – that’s not in issue – “and after having been required to have a preliminary breath test” – there’s evidence of that – “he was then further required to furnish a sample of breath analysis by breath analysing instrument pursuant to s55(1) of the Road Safety Act 1986” – that’s in issue... Now, the charge as framed alleges – the essential elements are time and place, driver and motor vehicle, a preliminary breath test, and then the Crown case is that [Mr Blair] was required to furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument pursuant to s55(1). That requirement having been made a requirement was then made to accompany for the purpose of that requirement. That’s the way that the Crown case has been framed. That essential element has not been proved. That direct question asked and direct answer given. Therefore the charge must fail.”</p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp; There followed extended debate between Mr Billings and the trial judge at the conclusion of which his Honour rejected Mr Billings’ submission. His Honour ruled[4] as follows: <br />“Mr Billings, on behalf of the appellant, submits that the information filed in this matter discloses or alleges an offence of refusing to furnish a sample of breath for analysis. Essentially that is what the submission he made to me amounts to. In my view, proper construction of the information alleges quite clearly an allegation that the appellant failed to comply with the request that he accompany the member of the police force to a police station for the purposes of furnishing a sample of breath pursuant to s55(1), and the submission made in relation to that, for the reasons which I have developed in argument with Mr Billings, fail.”</p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp; It appears that His Honour to some extent misunderstood Mr Billings’ submission but he concluded that the specific charge was clearly identified (and subsequently found that there was evidence to support all elements of that charge). </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp; Mr Billings then called Mr Blair to give evidence and after his evidence had been given, Mr Billings closed his case. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp; Having closed his case, Mr Billings immediately submitted that there was no evidence that the instrument in which Mr Blair furnished a sample of his breath as a preliminary breath test was an instrument which was a prescribed device. The prosecutor then said that no such evidence was led because “it was indicated that there was no issue about the preliminary breath test” and he applied to reopen his case to lead that evidence. Mr Billings then said (correctly) that he had not indicated that he would not take that point and that he was entitled to remain silent and ask the Crown to prove its case. The trial judge said that he got the impression from the discussion before the informant had arrived that there was one real issue and that was a question of fact as to whether the requirement had been made. Debate followed between the trial judge and Mr Billings as to whether any prejudice would be suffered by the reopening of the case and as to whether proof of a prescribed device was a “formal proof” or “an essential element of the charge”. After some further debate the trial judge decided to exercise his discretion to permit the prosecution to reopen its case so as to identify the preliminary breath testing device and prove that it was a prescribed device. His Honour, while recognising that the discretion to permit the prosecution’s case to be reopened should rarely be exercised, said in substance that his grounds for doing so were that the prosecution had in the circumstances considered that this element of proof was not an issue and that it was irrelevant to the real issue for decision. The informant was then called and gave the relevant evidence. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp; The County Court convicted Mr Blair, ordered that his licence be cancelled and that he be disqualified from driving in the State of Victoria for a period of 24 months, effective from 3 June 2004. Further, Mr Blair was fined $600 together with statutory costs of $34. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp; As I have said, Mr Billings of Counsel for Mr Blair advanced two grounds for the setting aside of the conviction. The first and primary ground relied upon was that there was a lack or excess of jurisdiction, or an error of law on the face of the record, in that the evidence did not support that element of the charge which alleged that “he was then further required to furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument pursuant to Section 55(1) of the Road Safety Act 1986”. The second ground was that the conviction should be set aside because there was a failure to accord procedural fairness to Mr Blair, or a breach of the rules of natural justice, by permitting the prosecution to reopen its case to prove that the preliminary breath test device was a prescribed device. However, Mr Billings conceded that it was open to a reasonable judge to exercise the discretion to permit the prosecution to reopen its case in all the circumstances and he said that he did not contend that the Court had acted beyond jurisdiction in so exercising its discretion. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp; Whatever else might be said against the first ground advanced on behalf of Mr Blair, I am satisfied that it should be rejected because the prosecution did not fail to prove all elements of the charge. It was common ground that the offence charged was that of refusing to comply with a requirement to accompany a member of the police force to a police station for the purpose of furnishing a sample of breath for analysis, contrary to ss49(1)(e) and 55(1) of the Road Safety Act 1986. It is established that proof of the “requirement” under that section does not require proof of a formal demand in relation to each element.[5] It is sufficient if a demand or requirement is made in substance and in comprehensible terms. Indeed, Mr Billings did not contend to the contrary[6] – his contention was that the charge as framed contained an element which was not proved. However, the element to which he referred was not one which was necessary to proof of the charge and simply arose from what I would regard as an inelegant drafting of the charge. The language used in the charge did not turn it into a different charge. There was surplus verbiage in the charge and it is not suggested that this was in any way misleading or prejudicial to the defence. Instead of the charge alleging that a requirement was made for the defendant to accompany a member of the police force to the police station for the purpose of furnishing a sample of breath for analysis, the charge alleged that the defendant was required to furnish a sample of breath for analysis [etc] and for that purpose such requirement was made. It was not a necessary part of the charge, nor was there any reason to think that it was so understood, that the member of the police force should have required the defendant to furnish a sample of breath for analysis at the time of requiring the defendant to accompany him to a police station. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp; Thus, although the charge was inelegantly drafted, it was not so confusing or obscure that it did not amount to a charge of the offence with which it was intended to deal.[7] A fair reading of the charge in the light of the statutory provisions shows that the so-called “element” which was not proved was not an essential ingredient of the charge but simply “arose” from the way that the charge was framed. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp; I conclude that all the essential elements of the charge were proved and that the defence was not misled or confused by the way the charge was framed. There was no jurisdictional error by the trial judge. Insofar as there was any error in the reasoning of the trial judge[8] his conclusion was correct in law. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp; Turning to the second ground, it was accepted that the prosecution should be permitted to reopen its case only in special or exceptional circumstances.[9] I note that Mr Billing’s concession mentioned above[10] necessarily involves a concession that it was open to a reasonable judge to consider in the present case that such special or exceptional circumstances existed. How then could there have been any lack of procedural fairness? In any event I am satisfied that no lack of procedural fairness or any unfairness to the defence has been shown. In the circumstances described, in paras [8]-[9] and [11]-[13] above, and having regard to the explicit statements made by the defence about what were and were not issues, justice required that the prosecution be permitted to reopen its case[11] in order to lead evidence as to a matter which it was reasonably entitled to assume was not in issue. There was no apparent prejudice or risk of prejudice to the defence in relation to this discrete issue which, in the forensic circumstances of this case, was a matter of formal proof only. No injustice was thereby done to Mr Blair. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp; For the foregoing reasons this proceeding should be dismissed.

In those circumstances, ABC submitted that the criminal blame lay entirely with the two staff and not the company. During the hearing certain materials were tendered to the magistrate concerning the systems in place at the centre, the records concerning the past behaviour of the child and the physical modifications made to the centre subsequent to the incident.

Where such a company operates a child care centre with staff who fail to perform these obligations, the company can be held accountable and the staff do not bear the potential liability alone. <br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, the magistrate correctly applied the Act and the governing legal principles when he found that the proprietor ABC as a company could and would be held criminally accountable in a court of law.<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Examined as a whole the reasons do not suggest the magistrate took the materials into account as a basis for finding the charges against ABC proven. To the contrary, the reasons suggest that, on the issue of criminal liability, he confined himself to the case put by the prosecution. The materials were tendered as background, which is where they are in the reasons for decision. Accordingly, the magistrate did not take impermissible materials into account in reaching his decision.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">BELL J:</span><br style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold" /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">INTRODUCTION</span><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>In 2003 a child aged nearly three got out of a child care centre into the surrounding streets while the staff were not looking. Fortunately he was returned unharmed by a neighbour shortly afterwards.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 26 of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>1996 required the proprietor of the centre, ABC Developmental Learning Centres Pty Ltd, and its staff, to ensure that every reasonable precaution was taken to protect the child from any hazard likely to cause injury. Section 27 required the company and its staff to ensure that he was adequately supervised.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Department of Human Services, through its officer Joanne Wallace, prosecuted ABC in the Magistrates’ Court at Sunshine for breaching ss26 and 27. It could have prosecuted the staff as well but it did not.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An acting magistrate found the child got out because ABC’s staff failed to observe, and prevent, him from scaling a playground fence with a 90cm square foam cube that he pushed 12 metres for this purpose. His Honour held ABC was ultimately responsible for the failures of its staff, whether or not they too were responsible. He fined the company $200.00 without conviction on the inadequate supervision charge. He dismissed the other charge without penalty.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ABC is aggrieved and raises in this appeal[1] a fundamental question of law: should the failures of ABC’s staff have been attributed to the company? Not in these circumstances, it contends, because there was no allegation of systemic or similar failure against the company. Therefore, the staff, if anybody, were entirely to blame. ABC also contends the acting magistrate erred in law by taking impermissible materials into account.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">SHOULD THE FAILURES OF ABC’S STAFF HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE COMPANY?</span><br style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold" /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The correct approach to answering this question</span><br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission</span>[2] Lord Hoffmann, on behalf of the Privy Council, identified an approach for determining when, in the criminal law, the actions of employees or similar persons can be attributed to a company. This decision has been frequently followed or cited with approval in various contexts.[3] In particular, in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions Reference No 1 of 1996</em>[4], Callaway JA, a member of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria, stated that the approach identified by Lord Hoffmann was correct as a "framework for analysis". This statement is non-binding but persuasive and, with respect, I agree with it. It was made in a case concerning the liability of a corporation for a different kind of crime but it is equally applicable here.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Meridian</em> dealt with a number of issues, including whether a company can be found guilty of a particular crime at all. I need not consider this question here. There is no doubt that ABC, as a company, must comply with ss26 and 27 of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>and that, in an appropriate case, it can be found to have committed the crime of failing to do so. I will go straight to the heart of the matter – crimes arising out of the conduct of low-level employees.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to Lord Hoffmann, there is no one answer to the question whether the criminal actions of employees (or directors or contractors) of a company can be counted as the actions of the company. In some cases it is necessary to fashion a special rule of attribution. Depending on the scope of the rule, the actions of the employees may or may not be attributed to the company. The scope of the rule will depend upon the court’s interpretation of the terms of the offence and the policy of the enabling statute[5].<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether the actions of high-level or low-level employees will be attributed to the company will depend upon the circumstances. The matter was put succinctly by Callaway JA[6]:<br />"Sometimes only the board of directors acting as such or a person near the top of the corporation’s organisation will be identified with the corporation itself. On other occasions someone lower, and perhaps much lower, in the hierarchy will suffice."<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where the employees are high-level, it may be possible to identify the company with their actions because they represent its directing mind and will[7]. Where the employees are low-level, as in this appeal, the company can still be identified with their actions if this is required by the terms of the offence and the achievement of the policy objectives of the enabling statute. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The need to ascertain the nature of the offence and the policy of the statute comes through strongly in the decided cases. For example, in <em>Meridian </em>itself, officers of the company acquired substantial securities in a public company without making disclosure to the market. Their actions were taken to be the actions of the company, which was prosecuted, in the words of Lord Hoffmann, because the policy of the statute was "to compel, in fast-moving markets, the immediate disclosure of the identity of persons who become substantial security holders" in public companies.[8] In <em>McNicholas Construction Co Ltd v Customs and Excise Commissioners</em>[9], the actions of all of the employees involved in the making and receiving of supplies were counted as the actions of the company in a tax prosecution because the policy of the statute was to discourage the dishonest evasion of tax. In <em>Linework Ltd v Department of Labour</em>[10], the omissions of the foreman in charge of a work site counted as the omissions of the company in an occupational health and safety prosecution because the statute was concerned with the safety of employees at work and required the employer to provide on-the-job supervision of safety practices.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These cases all have an important feature in common with the present case – the offences concerned were regulatory in nature. Such offences are typically created in legislation regulating a sphere of social or economic activity in the public interest. The legislation may, in that sphere, lay down a standard of action or behaviour for everybody bound by the legislation, companies and natural persons, to follow. If the person does not follow the standard, the legislation may allow he, she or it to be prosecuted for an offence.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thus in <em>Meridian</em>, the legislation was designed to ensure full and frank disclosure in the securities trading market. In <em>McNicholas</em>, the legislation was designed to prevent tax avoidance. In <em>Linework</em>, the legislation was designed to prevent workers being injured at work. In the present case, as we shall see, the legislation was designed to ensure that children were properly cared for in children’s services.<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This feature is important because, where legislation lays down a standard of action or behaviour in the public interest, a company, being an abstract legal entity, can observe the standard only through human agents. To return to my case examples, the company must have employees or similar persons to make full and frank disclosure, to record taxable transactions, to protect the safety of workers at work and, I might add, to properly take care of children. If the persons appointed by the company to observe the standard do not do so, it would frustrate the objectives of the legislation if the company could not be held criminally liable. The imposition of criminal liability is one important way by which persons, including companies, are held accountable for breaching regulatory standards which, on pain of such liability, they are obliged to observe. Therefore, where appropriate, the courts will fashion a rule of attribution that counts, as a company’s, the actions of employees, of whatever level, whose work involves the performance of a regulatory obligation on the company’s behalf. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It may be said on behalf of defendant companies, as ABC says here, that they should not be held liable if they had good systems in place, if they did not know the standard was being breached or if the employee was acting contrary to instructions. The company may say, "what more could have been done?" In many cases, unless relevant to a specific statutory defence, circumstances such as these will not be to the point.[11] The legislation will simply expect the standard to be performed because it serves important public interests such as those illustrated above. If the legislature wants to include a defence of good systems, lack of knowledge or ignoring instructions, it can do so. Often it will not. Then, whether or not these circumstances are present, and depending upon the nature of the offence and the policy of the enabling legislation, the company may be found liable because an employee, acting within the scope of his or her work, has failed to perform a regulatory obligation that binds the company. As the Court of Appeal of New Zealand said in <em>Linework</em>[12] –<br />"To ask, as the appellant’s counsel did, what more the employer could have done, is to beg the question: whose acts and omissions are to be attributed to the employer?"<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That is enough description of the correct approach. I will now examine the nature of the charges brought against ABC and the policy of the <em>Children’s Services Act</em>.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">The nature of the charges brought against ABC and the policy of the <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Children’s Services Act.</span></span><br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 26 provides:<br />"<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">26. Protection of children from hazards</span><br />(1) The proprietor of a children’s service must ensure that every reasonable precaution is taken to protect children being cared for or educated by the service from any hazard likely to cause injury.<br />Penalty: 50 penalty units.<br />(2) A staff member of a children’s service must ensure that every reasonable precaution is taken to protect a child in the care of that staff member from any hazard likely to cause injury.<br />Penalty: 50 penalty units."<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 27 provides:<br />"<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">27. Inadequate supervision of children</span><br />(1) The proprietor of a children’s service must ensure that all children being cared for or educated by the service are adequately supervised at all times that children are on the premises where the service operates or in the care of that service.<br />Penalty: 50 penalty units.<br />(2) A staff member of a children’s service must ensure that any child in the care of that staff member is adequately supervised. <br />Penalty: 50 penalty units."<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These offences are expressed in terms of a mandatory standard for the protection and supervision of children enforced by a penalty for breach. Intention to breach the expressed standard is not an element of the offences created. The offences are committed by the objective failure of the person to meet the specified standard, whether the failure was deliberate or inadvertent. This is apparent from the terms of ss26 and 27 and also from the fact that the legislature has not included the defence of taking reasonable steps and exercising due diligence, as it did in relation to the different offence of publishing an advertisement for an unlicensed children’s service (s8(1) and (2)).<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The proprietor" referred to in ss26(1) and 27(1) is defined in s3(1) to include the owner of the service and any person who manages or control it. In the present case this included ABC.<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 1 specifies the main purpose of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>to be the licensing and regulation of children’s services. A "children’s service" is defined in s3(1) to be "a service providing care or education for 5 or more children under the age of 6 years in the absence of their parents or guardians..." Children of such a young age in the absence of their parents or guardians for potentially long periods during the day are an extremely vulnerable group in our community. The policy of the legislation is the provision of protection, supervision and care of such children by children’s services in whose custody they may be entrusted. This policy was strongly stated by Dr Dennis Napthine, the Minister for Youth and Community Services, in the Second Reading Speech for the introduction of the legislation on 30 May 1996:<br />"The family remains the cornerstone in providing care for children. Increasingly, however, families are requiring access to children’s services...<br />The government is cognisant of increasing community demands for children’s services where parents can be confident that their children will receive quality care in a safe environment. As greater numbers of very young children receive care away from their parents, it is paramount that there is in place a legislative framework that ensures the safety and wellbeing of those children.<br />Families want to be assured that they can depend on legislation – and the regulations that will follow – that provides a system of children’s services that delivers high quality programs while at the same time being flexible and responsive in meeting the complex and evolving needs of families."<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The legislation enforces this policy in various ways.<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is an offence to own, operate, manage or control a children’s service without a licence (s7). <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A person can apply for approval in principle to use particular premises for operating a service (s9). This approval cannot be given unless the Secretary is satisfied the person is a fit and proper person (s10(2)). If the applicant is a company, the Secretary must be satisfied a director or other officer in control is a fit and proper person (also s10(2)). The Secretary can take into account whether the person, director or controlling officer had been found guilty of an offence against the <em>Children’s Services Act</em>, which would include ss26 and 27 (s11(1)(b)). The Secretary can revoke an approval in principle if the fit and proper person ceases to be fit and proper (s14).<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a similar scheme for making applications for licences (see Div. 2 of Part 3). The application must be refused if the Secretary is satisfied that the applicant, who must be a person to whom approval in principle was given (s16(1)), is not or is no longer a fit and proper person to operate a children’s service (s17(1)(a)(ii)). A licence is subject to a compulsory condition that the service be operated in a way which ensures the safety of the children being cared for or educated (s18(4)). The licence can be cancelled if the Secretary is satisfied that the licensee had been found guilty of an offence against the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>or the licensee has failed to comply with the compulsory safety condition (s45(1)(c) and (e)). <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Officers authorised by the Secretary (s35) are given powers of entry, inspection and seizure for the purpose of ascertaining whether the legislation is being complied with (s36).<br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a wide regulation-making power (s56(1)).<br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We can see that the offences specified in ss26(1) and 27(1) are designed to protect children and are an important component of the scheme by which the policy of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>is implemented. A children’s service proprietor that is a company can only protect children from hazards and supervise them through employees, contract staff and similar persons. In my view the terms of the offences and the policy of the legislation are such that the actions of such persons done within the scope of their work can be attributed to the company. If their actions do not comply with the standards expressed in ss26(1) and 27(1), this can count as non-compliance by the company for the purposes of a prosecution. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I will now deal with four particular submissions made by counsel for ABC. <br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First, reliance was placed upon the fact that the staff of a children’s service can also be criminally liable under ss26(2) and 27(2). Counsel for ABC submitted this shows the legislature did not intend a proprietor company to be liable for the failures of its staff. Something more is required before the company can be held liable, such as a systems failure. If the non-compliance is due only to the actions of the company’s staff, they, not it, are liable.<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I must reject this submission. The provisions of ss26 and 27 impose concurrent obligations, on pain of criminal penalty, on both the proprietor and the staff. The intent is to ensure that management, who control the children’s service, and staff, who directly provide the care or education, are both bound to protect the children from hazards and adequately supervise them. Depending upon the circumstances, both or either may be prosecuted for breach. Whether either or both are charged is a matter for the discretion of the prosecutor. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acceptance of the submission of counsel for ABC would transform the nature of the offences created by ss26(1) and 27(1) in their application to incorporated proprietors. Instead of having to establish that the children had not been protected or supervised in the manner specified in these provisions, it would be necessary to establish that there had been a systems failure or something of that kind. The provisions do not operate in this way. The provisions apply upon the objective fact of non-compliance (see above). It is not necessary to establish anything more because the proprietor happens to be a company.<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second, counsel for ABC submitted that Linework was distinguishable because there the legislation expressly provided that duties imposed on one person did not diminish duties imposed on other persons.[13] I do not think the principles expressed in <em>Meridian</em>, as applied in <em>Linework</em>, were much influenced by these provisions. In any event ss26 and 27 of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>expressly impose the same duties upon proprietors and staff.<br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third, counsel for ABC noted that the worker in Linework was the foreman for the whole of the work site and therefore was not really a low-level employee. It is true the Court of Appeal saw this worker to be at the appropriate level for the purpose of fashioning the attribution rule relevant to the circumstances of that case. In other cases, such as the present, a court, applying the same principles, may see a worker at a lower level to be appropriate.<br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fourth, reliance was placed upon <em>R v Nelson Group Services (Maintenance) Ltd.</em>[14] In that case the Court of Appeal proceeded upon the basis that the activities of the company’s workers were "part of the conduct by the [company] of their undertaking."[15] The aspects of the decision relied upon by counsel for ABC concerned the operation of the particular statutory defence that was in issue in that case and do not assist in the resolution of the issues in the present case.<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I therefore conclude that the acting magistrate correctly decided ABC could be found guilty of the offences by reason of the failures of its staff. It remains to consider whether the acting magistrate erred in law in deciding that it should be so found in the present case.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Did the acting magistrate err in law in finding ABC guilty of the offences?</span><br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How the child got out was either admitted or not in dispute. In the afternoon of 17 April 2003 the child was one of 12 being cared for by three staff, two employees and one other brought in from an agency. At the critical time one of these staff went to the toilet, leaving the children in the care of the other two. These two had a clear and uninterrupted view of the position from which the foam cube was pushed to the playground fence. When the staff member returned from the toilet, a head count revealed the absence of the child.<br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A search was conducted during which the child’s mother arrived to take him home. At about 4.50pm, about 10 minutes after his escape, he was brought back by a neighbour who found him in a nearby street. In the words of the acting magistrate, the child "was not distressed and appeared unaware of the crisis he had caused." <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DHS brought the prosecution upon the narrow basis that the child’s escape was an instance of failing to take every reasonable precaution to protect the child (s26(1)) and of failing adequately to supervise him (s27(1)). <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The acting magistrate found the two child care workers (not the third) had failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the child from hazards and adequately to supervise him. These findings were plainly correct and ABC did not contend otherwise.<br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The acting magistrate decided the failures of the two staff "were the failures of the Company." This is the finding that ABC contends was wrong in law. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The specific question of law I must answer is whether the identified failures of the two child care workers could be attributed to ABC for the purposes of the prosecution under ss26(1) and 27(1). In my view the acting magistrate correctly answered this question in the affirmative. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The protection and supervision of children in the playground of a child care centre, which includes preventing them from escaping, are important obligations of a proprietor under ss26(1) and 27(1) of the <em>Children’s Services Act</em>. These are obligations of a kind that ABC – as a company – has to rely upon staff (employees, contractors or others) to perform. The scope of the work of the two relevant workers involved the performance of these obligations on behalf of the company. The nature of the offences and the policy of the legislation are such that the failures of the workers to do so can be attributed to ABC, as the acting magistrate decided.<br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ABC submits the acting magistrate was wrong because DHS made no allegation of systemic failure, management breakdown or employment of insufficient or underqualified staff. These matters go to penalty not guilt. The obligations specified in the legislation apply to all proprietors – whatever their systems, efficiency of management and sufficiency and qualifications of staff. All must comply with the standards expressed in ss26(1) and 27(1). <br /><strong>45.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have pointed out the acting magistrate fined ABC $200.00, without conviction, on the inadequate supervision charge and dismissed the failing to protect charge without penalty. The maximum penalty for each of these charges was 50 penalty units (see above). When ABC committed the offences, a penalty unit was $100.00.[16] So ABC was fined, without conviction, two-fiftieths of the maximum on the one charge not dismissed. The acting magistrate was clearly of the view that, having regard to the circumstances, nothing more was called for. I agree. The duty of the acting magistrate was simply to vindicate the interest of the community in holding the company to account for the failures of duty that occurred at its centre, which is what he did. <br /><strong>46.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Despite this lenient approach, ABC has appealed to this Court. It has done so on what it sees to be a point of principle, which is its right. But I must answer this point of principle firmly against ABC. There was no error of law in the decision of the acting magistrate. Under the <em>Children’s Services Act</em>, if a company operates a children’s service with staff who fail to protect or adequately supervise children, the company can be held liable and the staff do not bear the potential criminal responsibility alone. <br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">DID THE ACTING MAGISTRATE TAKE IMPERMISSIBLE MATERIALS INTO ACCOUNT?</span><br /><strong>47.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This issue arises because certain materials were tendered to the acting magistrate and received into evidence during the hearing. The materials concerned the systems in place at the centre, the records concerning the past behaviour of the child and the physical modifications made to the centre subsequent to the incident. The materials were tendered by consent, but by way of background and not because they were legally relevant to any issue concerning the criminal liability of ABC. <br /><strong>48.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The materials were not legally relevant to the criminal liability of ABC because, as I have pointed out, the prosecution was not based upon the occurrence of a systems failure at the centre or anything of that kind. At the start of the hearing counsel for DHS made it clear that the case against ABC was simply that the child escaped due to inadequate protection and supervision. Therefore, if the acting magistrate did take the materials into account in finding the two charges against ABC proven, he may have committed an error of law. <br /><strong>49.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The acting magistrate referred to the materials in his decision. This passage illustrates his reasoning very well:<br />"I am satisfied that the failure of [the two staff] to adequately supervise the children in their care and to protect them from hazards were the failures of the Company.<br />Moreover the actions of the Company taken after this incident, referred to earlier, together with the existence of Centre records that noted [the child’s] propensity to climb and explore would indicate a number of failures further up the management claim [sic]. <br />They are not factors however upon which I base my decision."<br /><strong>50.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The subject of this passage is the attribution of the failures of the staff to ABC. The first sentence reveals the acting magistrate’s finding that the charges against ABC were established upon the precise basis put by the prosecution. The second sentence reads like an observation made after this finding rather than a reason for making it, which is consistent with the disavowal in the third sentence.<br /><strong>51.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Just because the acting magistrate said he did not base his decision upon the materials does not mean he did not in fact take them into account. I must determine myself whether he did so by reference to the reasons for decision and whatever else may be relevant to this question. <br /><strong>52.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Examined as a whole the reasons do not suggest the acting magistrate took the materials into account as a basis for finding the charges against ABC proven. To the contrary, the reasons suggest that, on the issue of criminal liability, he confined himself to the case put by the prosecution. The materials were tendered as background, which is where they are in the reasons for decision.<br /><strong>53.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the matter can be objectively tested by reference to the acting magistrate’s approach to sentencing ABC. We have seen he found both charges proven. He fined the company $200.00 without conviction on the inadequate supervision charge. He dismissed the other charge without penalty. This was a lenient approach, which he considered to be appropriate in the circumstances. If the acting magistrate had reasoned that the offending conduct included a failure by management to maintain proper protective and supervisory systems, it is most unlikely he would have adopted this approach. Offending conduct constituted by failures of a systemic kind would have counted as an aggravating factor demanding a higher penalty.<br /><strong>54.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I therefore conclude the acting magistrate did not take the materials into account in finding the charges against ABC proven.<br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">CONCLUSION</span><br /><strong>55.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ABC Developmental Learning Centres Pty Ltd was charged in the Magistrates’ Court at Sunshine with two offences against the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>after a child aged nearly three got out of a child care centre of which it was the proprietor. The offences – failing to take reasonable precautions to protect the child from hazards and failing adequately to supervise him – were found proven. An acting magistrate fined ABC $200.00 without conviction on the first charge and dismissed the second without penalty.<br /><strong>56.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ABC has appealed because the escape of the child was due to the failures of two of its staff and not to a lack of proper management, or a breakdown in the general system of child care, at the centre. In these circumstances, it contends, criminal blame, if any, lies entirely with the two staff and not with the company.<br /><strong>57.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The critical consideration in this case is that the policy of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>is the protection of children. Young children in the absence of their parents or guardians for potentially long periods during the day are an extremely vulnerable group in our community. The legislation makes provision for the protection, supervision and care of such children by services into whose custody they have been entrusted. <br /><strong>58.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By reference to the protective policy of the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>and the nature of the relevant offences, I conclude that the obligation to protect and supervise children may be criminally enforced against both a proprietor company and its staff. Where such a company operates a child care centre with staff who fail to perform these obligations, the company can be held accountable and the staff do not bear the potential liability alone.<br /><strong>59.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The facts of the present case were that a young child who was neither properly protected nor adequately supervised got out of an ABC child care centre into the surrounding streets where he was exposed to potential harm. My judgment is that the acting magistrate correctly applied the <em>Children’s Services Act </em>and the governing legal principles when he decided that the proprietor, ABC, as a company, could and would be held criminally accountable in a court of law. <br /><strong>60.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ABC also contended the acting magistrate took impermissible materials into account in reaching his decision but in my view he did not do so.<br /><strong>61.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For these reasons I dismiss the appeal of ABC.<br /></p>\r\n<hr style="WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: 2px" />[1] The appeal is brought on a question of law under s92(1) of the <em>Magistrates Court Act </em>1989. <br />[2] [1995] 2 AC 500. <br />[3] <em>The City of Perth and Ors v DL </em>(Representing the Members of People Living With Aids (WA) (Inc) and Ors BC960167 (27 March 1996) at 30 per Ipp J (as a member of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia); <em>Australian Competition Consumer Commission v J McPhee &amp; Son (Australia) Pty Ltd </em>[1997] 469 FCA (19 May 1997) per Heerey J (Federal Court of Australia); <em>Duke Group Limited (in liquidation) v Pilmer &amp; Ors</em> (1999) 73 SASR 64 at 189 per Doyle CJ, Duggan and Bleby JJ (Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia); <em>AAPT Ltd v Cable &amp; Wireless Optus Ltd and Others </em>(1999) 32 ACSR 63 at 88 per Austin J (Supreme Court of New South Wales); <em>Americano’s Ltd v State Insurance Ltd </em>(1999) 10 ANZ Insurance Cases 75,225 at 75,226 per Young J (High Court of New Zealand); <em>McNicholas Constructions Co Ltd v Customs and Excise Commissioners</em> [2000] STC 553 at 573 per Dyson J (Queens Bench Division); <em>Attorney-General’s Reference (No. 2 of 1999) </em>[2000] QB 796 at 810 and 814 – 816 per Rose LJ, Potts and Curtis JJ (Court of Appeal); <em>Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission v Simsmetal Limited and Ors </em>[2000] FCA 818 (20 June 2000) at [20] per Heerey J; <em>Linework Ltd v Department of Labour </em>[2001] 2 NZLR 639 at 645 per Richardson P, Thomas, Blanchard, Tipping and McGrath JJ (Court of Appeal of New Zealand); <em>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd and Another </em>(2003) 129 FCR 339 at 411 per Heerey and Sackville JJ, Emmett J agreeing at 434 (Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia); <em>Minister for Environment and Heritage v Greentree and Others </em>(2004) 138 FCR 198 at 250 per Sackville J. <br />[4] [1998] 3 VR 352 at 355.

They needed finance so they approached a company which traded under the business name of NRA Recovery. An agreement was reached between the parties for finance to be supplied to RGP/L. There was no suggestion that NRA Recovery acted as an agent. The debt remained unpaid and subsequently a company LNP/L took proceedings to recover the sum of $2443.00 from RGP/L. At the hearing there was no direct evidence to the effect that NRA Recovery was acting as an agent in the transaction which gave rise to the claim. Nor was there any evidence about the terms of the relationship between NRA Recovery and LNP/L. The magistrate found that NRA Recovery acted as agent for LNP/L and made an order for the amount sought. Upon appeal—<br /><strong>HELD: Appeal allowed. Judgement set aside. Claim dismissed.<br />1.&nbsp;When the hearing below came to its end, the first question for the magistrate to answer was whether there existed at the material time a relationship of principal and agent between LNP/L as principals and NRA Recovery as agent. In the absence of that relationship, LNP/L were not parties to the contract upon which they relied. Therefore, unless the magistrate were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that such a relationship existed, LNP/L must fail: with a few exceptions, none of which are presently relevant, the rule is that only a party to a contract can sue on it.<br />2.&nbsp;Even if a principal/agent relationship existed, that would not have been the end of the matter. LNP/L would still fail unless they established on the balance of probabilities that RGP/L either knew that NRA Recovery was acting as an agent (or were willing or led NRA Recovery to believe that they were willing) to treat as a party to the contract anyone on whose behalf NRA Recovery may have been authorised to contract.<br />3.&nbsp;There was no evidence of either the requisite willingness or of the agent being led to believe that such willingness had been displayed. The evidence called before the magistrate was insufficient to allow him to find that LNP/L were parties to the contract with RGP/L. Accordingly, it was not open to the magistrate to find for LNP/L and make an order on the claim. <br />&nbsp;<br />HARPER J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;The respondents are financiers. They claim that they contracted to provide finance to the first appellant, and that any resultant indebtedness was guaranteed by the second appellant. Finance was made available accordingly. Yet the debt remains unpaid. Proceedings for its recovery were brought in the Magistrates’ Court. The respondents obtained judgment in the sum of $2,443.00. It was left to the parties to agree on interest and costs.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The appellants have appealed to this Court. The principal ground argued before me was that the respondents were not parties to the relevant agreement; or, more accurately, that the evidence called before the court below was not sufficient to enable the magistrate properly to conclude that, on the balance of probabilities, the respondents were contracting parties. The respondents assert in response that they were what they claimed to be – financiers who through their agent contracted to provide financial accommodation to the first appellant – albeit that their identity was not disclosed to either appellant, and the terms of their relationship with the agent not fully disclosed, if disclosed at all, to the Court. In the circumstances, the magistrate was nevertheless entitled to find that the appellants were indebted to them.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The first appellant is the holding company of a group of three companies, two of which (the two subsidiaries of the first appellant) trade, or at material times traded, as motor vehicle repairers. Obtaining timely payment for this work is often difficult: either insurers take time to decide whether to accept liability, or clients (or third parties) who are uninsured have difficulty procuring the necessary funds, or for some other reason payment to the repairer is delayed.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The consequence is that motor vehicle repairers frequently need financial accommodation. So it was with the repairers with which this appeal is concerned. The magistrate, in a finding that was contested before him but not called into question before me, held that it was not either of the two subsidiaries, but the first appellant, which sought finance by means of a factoring arrangement. It approached for this purpose a company called Danemark Pty Ltd. That company traded under the business name "NRA Recovery" or "National Repairers Association Recovery". It was not a party to the proceedings.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;An agreement was reached. Insofar as it is in writing, it is to be found in a document headed "Authority" and dated 25 October 2002; and in a letter dated 28 February 2003 under the letterhead of "NRA Recovery". Neither document refers, whether directly or indirectly, to either respondent. Each is couched in terms that are consistent with the conclusion that NRA Recovery for the one part and the appellants for the other are the only principal contracting parties. No hint that NRA Recovery acts as an agent is to be found in either document, save for the financier’s signature clause, which consists of the expression "For NRA Recovery, and on behalf of the Factorer: LPL Factoring". None of the witnesses called before the magistrate could identify any entity trading under the latter name. Moreover, none of the evidence then before the Court suggested that the appellants understood that those words, or anything else in the relationship with NRA Recovery, indicated that that entity acted as an agent for anyone, let alone either respondent. Nor did the magistrate find that the appellants or either of them were aware that NRA Recovery was at the material times acting as an agent. He proceeded, it seems, on the mere assumption that there was evidence of a relationship of principal and agency between the respondents on the one hand, and NRA Recovery on the other, that that evidence established the fact, and that that was enough to bind the appellants to a contract the other parties to which were, unbeknown to them, the respondents.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;In truth, the Magistrates’ Court proceedings paid little attention to the laws of evidence, and neither case was coherently presented. Statements of fact were made from the bar table. Documents were tendered, but not formally received into evidence. If objection was taken to a particular tender, the hearing moved on without any resolution of that issue; and the status of the tendered document was therefore difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain. Questions were dealt with as if they, as much or more than the answers, were the evidence. The magistrate, who gave no reasons for judgment, did not identify the evidence upon which he was prepared to act. One consequence is that a reading of the transcript does not permit of a clear picture of the material upon the basis of which the magistrate formulated his conclusions. At best for the respondents, however, it could be argued that the evidence disclosed that the sum alleged to constitute the amount provided (by cheque drawn on the trust account of NRA Recovery) to the motor vehicle repair business as financial accommodation was, unbeknown to the appellants, sourced in part from one respondent and in larger part from the other. Necessarily, therefore, some connection between the respondents and NRA Recovery had been established.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;I should first examine the evidence in a little more detail. The document headed "Authority" states in clause 1 that "The repairer ... applies for credit from NRA Recovery (‘NRA’) and agrees to NRA’s terms of credit and of any factoring ... The terms ... may be changed by NRA from time to time ... ". Clause 2 allows NRA, in its complete discretion, to decide whether or not to provide credit. Moreover, by clause 4, the relationship may be determined at any time by NRA. By clause 5, any director of a corporate repairer guarantees to NRA the repayment to that entity of the liabilities of the corporation, and seeks to make the director a principal debtor to NRA. The repairer, by clause 7, agrees to repay to NRA "any monies due and owing by way of a shortfall should the factored vehicle be re-assessed after factoring payment has been received by the repairer and there is a shortfall difference...". Clause 8 provides that the repairer is to repay to NRA, immediately upon request, "all monies due and owing should any third party claim be denied". Finally, clause 9 expresses the repairer’s agreement to the payment of commission fees "for any rollovers of factoring ... as agreed between the repairer and NRA".<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Two other forms were tendered with the form of Authority in the Magistrates’ Court. One is headed "NRA Recovery Confidential Credit Application." It does not suggest that the financier is acting in any capacity other than that of principal. The second form is headed "NRA Recovery – Client Details". It likewise contains no hint that the financier is an agent.<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The letter of 28 February 2003 is, as I have noted, written on the letterhead of "NRA Recovery". It gives its address as "National Repairers Assoc. [sic] Recovery, Level 1, 493 Little Bourke Street Melbourne". It provides among other things, that recovery fees "will be paid to NRA Recovery". Apart from the ambiguous signatory clause, which could be (but probably is not) a reference to another business name under which Danemark Pty Ltd trades, and in fact is a reference which no witness could explain, there is, again, no hint that the transaction was one entered into by NRA Recovery as an agent for anybody.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiffs/respondents called two witnesses in the proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court. One was an employee of NRA Recovery. The period of her employment did not extend back as far as the time when the relevant contract was made. Her evidence is irrelevant to the issues before me. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;The second witness called by the plaintiffs was Mr Issac Brott. He is a solicitor and, as he described himself in cross-examination, "effectively the owner of ... NRA Recovery." He said in his evidence in chief that the second appellant, Mr Green, approached him on many occasions to "obtain factoring monies on repair jobs." If, on assessment of an application, it in Mr Brott’s words, "stands up", "then we shop around for the money". He added that "there’s two kinds of money. The money we’ve got already and the money that has to be brought in depending on the particular job and the state of the factoring balances at the time." <strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;The second appellant (then the second defendant) was called to give evidence before the magistrate. He was asked by his counsel whether he had ever had dealings with either plaintiff (respondent). He swore that he had not. He was not cross-examined about this, or about whether the first defendant was in any different position.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;When the hearing below came to its end, the first question for the magistrate to answer was whether there existed at the material time a relationship of principal and agent between the respondents as principals and NRA Recovery as agent. In the absence of that relationship, the respondents were not parties to the contract upon which they relied. Unless, therefore, the magistrate were satisfied on the balance of probabilities that such a relationship existed, the plaintiffs/respondents must fail: with a few exceptions, none of which are presently relevant, the rule is that only a party to a contract can sue on it. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;There was no direct evidence to the effect that NRA Recovery was acting as an agent in the transaction which gave rise to the claim. The direct evidence was to the contrary. There was, it is true, the elliptical reference to "LPL Factoring"; but nothing in the evidence suggested that either defendant/appellant noticed that reference, let alone saw it as revealing NRA Recovery’s status as a mere agent. Looked at not subjectively, but objectively, the phrase in question was not, in my opinion, sufficient to alert the appellants to the fact (even assuming it were the fact) that NRA Recovery was a mere agent for the parties, and not itself the party, with whom they were contracting. If it matters, there was also no evidence that either defendant/appellant had ever previously done business with either plaintiff/respondent.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;An important circumstance is that there was no evidence before his Honour about the terms of the relationship between the respondents and NRA Recovery. In the absence of such evidence, it was not possible to find on the balance of probabilities that the relationship was that of principal and agent. It is at least as likely that NRA Recovery agreed as principal with the first appellant to factor the debt owed to the repairer by the owner of the particular vehicle being repaired. When it could, it drew on its own funds for this purpose; but if those funds were insufficient, it shopped around for a re-financier. On this occasion, it refinanced the transaction by resort to the respondents. As I read the evidence of Mr Brott, this is precisely what he was saying. If that were indeed the position, then of course it follows not only that the relationship between the respondents and NRA Recovery was not one of principal and agent, but also that it was one as between principals: financier (NRA Recovery) and re-financiers (the respondents). If it was, the respondents were not and are not parties to the contract upon which is founded their putative cause of action against the appellants.<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour’s judgment depended on the principal/agent relationship having been established. Yet, in the circumstances described above, the evidence did not allow the magistrate to find on the balance of probabilities that NRA Recovery acted as agent for the respondents. There being no evidence of the terms of the relationship between them, the magistrate was wrong to assume (no explicit finding was ever made) that it was one of principal and agent. Some other relationship was, for all the evidence disclosed, not simply equally open, but indeed more likely. Without giving the issue sufficient consideration, and with little if any assistance from counsel, or from the pleadings, the magistrate apparently proceeded simply on the basis that because there was some sort of connection between NRA Recovery and the respondents (and therefore between the respondents and the appellants) the principal/agent relationship was made out. But, apart from making the easy assumption that the first relationship was that of principal and agent, no-one took the trouble to analyse what hard evidence there was about that connection, and what its true nature might be.<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;The existence of the principal/agent relationship was thus a necessary element in the plaintiffs’ cause of action. Because it was not proved on the balance of probabilities, it was not open to the magistrate to find for the respondents. But even if it had been proved, that would not have been the end of the matter. Although a necessary element in the cause of action, the relationship of principal and agent was not sufficient. The respondents would still fail unless they established on the balance of probabilities that the defendants/appellants either knew that NRA Recovery was acting as an agent, or were willing (or led NRA Recovery to believe that they were willing) to treat as a party to the contract anyone on whose behalf NRA may have been authorised to contract. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The evidence is clear that neither appellant knew of any agency. They dealt with NRA Recovery as if it were a principal party to their contractual arrangements. Had the appellants been willing, or had either led NRA Recovery (on this hypothesis, the agent) to believe that it or he was willing, to treat as a party to the transaction anyone on whose behalf the agent may have been authorised to enter into the deal, then it would not matter that the identity of the respondents was not disclosed, or even that the appellants remained in ignorance of the existence of a principal/agency relationship.[1] But in this case, there is a total absence of any evidence of either the requisite willingness or of the agent being led to believe that such willingness had been displayed.<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;The absence of evidence is in some instances not a problem. There is authority for the proposition that, in the case of an ordinary commercial contract, willingness may be assumed by the agent unless the other party manifests his unwillingness, or there are other circumstances which should lead the agent to realise that the other party was not so willing.[2] But this was no ordinary commercial contract. It was, on the respondents’ own case, a factoring arrangement; and one side intended, without giving the other any notice, to split the provision of the relevant funds – and presumably the original (i.e. factored) debt – between two of the entities (the respondents) on that side, and in such proportions as those two privately agreed. If this could be done, the appellants would at some stage suddenly be faced (as they were) with two putative providers of finance, each claiming a share of the monies said to be owing. The appellants had then to attempt to work out how, if at all, the two claims corresponded with the total of their indebtedness, assuming they were indebted at all. Their willingness to allow themselves to be caught up in such an arrangement, especially given the nature of a factored debt, cannot be assumed. And, as senior counsel for the respondents said in the course of his submissions to me, the issue was not explored in the Court below: "That point was not made and it was not a point which arose in the case in any event."<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;On appeal, the respondents sought to rely on certain documents which, it was submitted on their behalf, were received into evidence during the hearing below. There is no doubt that the respondents sought to tender them. As far as one can gather, the respondents put them forward as bearing upon the relationship between the respondents and NRA Recovery. To the extent that they did so, their relevance was obvious. But objection was taken to that tender, on the ground that the documents, being copies, were not the best evidence. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;The objection had force, even though there was no suggestion that the copies were not genuine. They were copy letters from NRA Recovery to one or other of the respondents. The latter ought therefore to have had the originals in their possession. No attempt was made to explain why it was that copies from the NRA Recovery file were produced in lieu. Be that as it may, the hearing proceeded without the magistrate ruling on the objection at all.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;The respondents submitted, in effect, that the appellants had later waived any previous objection they had to the tender of the letters because in cross-examination counsel for the then defendants directed several questions about them to the first of the then plaintiffs’ witnesses. In my opinion this is a valid point, although one contrary argument could be that cross-examining counsel was understandably confused by the magistrate’s failure properly to rule on the earlier objection. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Even assuming that the correspondence in question thereby became part of the evidence, however, it does not advance the case of the respondents. True, each letter speaks of NRA Recovery’s confirmation "that we will be seeking the following factoring facility for you". Each, however, then goes on to refer to "[t]he terms of this factoring agreement"; and those terms are not the terms of the agreement upon which the respondents base their claim against the appellants. The latter contract provided for an "[a]mount to be factored" of $8,443.64. One of the letters provided for an "[a]mount to be factored" of $6,200.00; the other for an amount of $2,243.64. There were other, material, differences as well. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Those with an eye for figures and a touch of genius for mental arithmetic will observe that $6,200.00 and $2,243.64, when added together, total $8,443.64. If the mathematician is a lawyer as well, he or she – having studied the particulars of claim filed in the Magistrates’ Court – will also have observed that the two former amounts are there referred to as "[t]he amount factored as a principal sum". In each case, that amount then forms the base against which the total sum claimed to be owing is calculated. But this looks much more like an ordinary claim for repayment of a loan than a claim arising from a factoring agreement. The latter is defined in Butterworths Australian Legal Dictionary as "An arrangement for the selling of trade debts ... Usually the seller sells its receivables at a discount to a factor in return for immediate cash." This appears to coincide with, or – more accurately – describe, the contract between the appellants and NRA Recovery. It does not appear to describe the contract upon which the respondents sue. <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;The respondents’ position is therefore an impossible one. They allege that NRA Recovery acted as their agent in effecting a single contract with the appellants. They put that contract into evidence. They follow this by seeking to put into evidence, as their adoption of what their "agent" has done on their behalf, not one, but two, "contracts"; and these are, in addition, internally inconsistent with what they say is their agreement with the appellants, an agreement allegedly negotiated on their behalf by their agent.<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;It follows that, even if the respondents were in truth principals, albeit undisclosed, the evidence called before the magistrate was as a matter of law insufficient to allow him to find that they were parties to the contract with the appellants. It also follows that, as a matter of law, they had no standing as plaintiffs in this proceeding. The appeal must be allowed, the judgment below set aside, and in lieu thereof there must be judgment for the appellants.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] <em>Teheran-Europe Co.

Sections 31(5) and 31(5A) further provide:<br />“(5) If on the hearing of a charge under sub-section (1) the court finds the offender guilty of the offence, it may impose a level 10 fine and in addition must—<br />(a) restore the sentence or part sentence held in suspense and order the offender to serve it; or<br />(b) restore part of the sentence or part sentence held in suspense and order the offender to serve it; or<br />(c) in the case of a wholly suspended sentence, extend the period of the order suspending the sentence to a date not later than 12 months after the date of the order under this sub-section; or<br />(d) make no order with respect to the suspended sentence.<br />(5A) Despite anything to the contrary in sub-section (5), if on the hearing of a charge the court finds the offender guilty of the offence it must, in addition to any fine it may impose under sub-section (5), exercise the power referred to in paragraph (a) of that sub-section unless it is of the opinion that it would be unjust to do so in view of any exceptional circumstances which have arisen since the order suspending the sentence was made.”<br /><strong>The facts</strong><br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The Applicant was born on 31 December 1976. On 28 September 1999 he was committed for trial on a number of charges arising from business dealings between July 1996 and December 1997. He reserved his plea. On 3 November 1999 he was presented for trial before the County Court at Melbourne on two Presentments. Presentment No. C9901103.3 alleged five counts of Obtaining Property by Deception (counts 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9), three counts of Obtaining a Financial Advantage by Deception (counts 2, 3 and 8) and one count of Theft (count 7) and Presentment No. C9901103.4 alleged one count of Obtaining Property by Deception (count 2, six counts of Obtaining a Financial Advantage by Deception (counts 1, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10), two counts of Attempting to Obtain Property by Deception (counts 4 and 6) and one count of Attempting to Obtain a Financial Advantage by Deception (count 7). On 4 May 2000 he entered pleas of guilty to all 19 counts. After hearing a plea in mitigation of sentence, on 12 May, 2000 the judge sentenced the applicant as follows:<br />• On Presentment No. C9901103.3: to six months’ imprisonment on each of Counts 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9; to three months’ imprisonment on each of Counts 2, 3 and 8; and to twelve months’ imprisonment on Count 7. The judge ordered that two months of the sentence imposed upon Count 1 and one month of the sentence imposed upon Count 2 be served cumulatively upon each other and upon the sentence imposed upon Count 7, making a total sentence of 15 months. <br />• On Presentment No. C9901103.4: to three months’ imprisonment on each of Counts 1, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10; to nine months imprisonment on Count 2; to one month imprisonment on each of Counts 4 and 6; and to one month imprisonment on Count 7. The judge ordered that one month of the sentence imposed upon Count 1 be served cumulatively upon the sentence imposed upon Count 2, making a total sentence of 10 months imprisonment.<br />The judge further ordered that the total sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment imposed upon Presentment C9901103.4 be served cumulatively upon the total sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment imposed upon Presentment C9901103.3, thereby making for a total effective sentence of 25 months imprisonment, and that the whole of that sentence of imprisonment be suspended for a period of three years pursuant to s27 of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;By force of s206B of the <em>Corporations Act</em> 2001 (Cth), upon conviction of those offences of dishonesty the applicant was disqualified from managing a corporation for a period of five years from the date of conviction.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;On 15 April 2004, the applicant was charged on summons that he had between 1 September 2000 and 31 January 2003 committed two offences contrary to s206A of the Corporations Act 2001 of managing a corporation whilst disqualified and three offences contrary to s1308(2) of that Act of making a false or misleading statement in a document submitted to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. On 9 June 2004, he pleaded guilty before the Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne to those five charges and was convicted of each charge and fined an aggregate of $5,000.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;An offence under s206A of the <em>Corporations Act </em>carries a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units (ie. $5,000) or imprisonment for one year or both[1] and an offence under s1308(2) of the <em>Corporations Act </em>carries a maximum penalty of 200 penalty units (ie. $20,000) or imprisonment for five years or both.[2] Consequently, the applicant’s commission of the offences constituted a breach of the suspended sentence of imprisonment imposed on 12 May 2000.[3]<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;On 26 August 2004, the applicant was charged with the breach of the suspended sentence, pursuant to s31(1) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991. That charge came on for hearing in the County Court at Melbourne on 6 September 2005 before the same judge as had imposed the suspended sentence of imprisonment on 12 May 2000.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;After an extensive plea hearing in which counsel for the applicant called a number of witnesses and tendered several references, and after the judge had reserved his decision, on 12 September 2005 his Honour restored the whole of the sentence of imprisonment imposed on 12 May 2000 and ordered that the applicant serve not less than eight months of that sentence before being eligible for parole.<br /><strong>The judgment below</strong><br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the applicant argued before the sentencing judge that there were the following “exceptional circumstances” within the meaning of s31(5A) of the Act:<br />(1) The considerable delay between the offending between 1 September 2000 and 31 January 2003 and the institution of the breach proceedings on 26 August 2004.<br />(2) Evidence of improvement in the applicant’s psychological condition since the time of the original offending and the offending between 1 September 2000 and 31 January 2003.<br />(3) Evidence that since the offending between 1 September 2000 and 31 January 2003 the applicant had been rehabilitated in his commercial dealings.<br />(4) The dependence of members of the applicant’s family and business associates on the applicant continuing in his current employment.<br />(5) What was said to be the relative lack of seriousness of the breaching offences.<br />(6) The considerable support which the applicant had from family and friends.<br />(7) The fact that the applicant had complied with his bail obligations subsequent to a bail variation.<br />The judge, however, was not persuaded that any of those factors constituted “exceptional circumstances”, either singly or in combination.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour considered the delay, and thought that it was regrettable, but concluded that because the period of criminality did not cease until January 2003 and that there was then a period in which investigations were carried out, the delay was hardly inordinate. His Honour also had regard to a report by Mr Joblin, the forensic psychologist, in which it was said that the applicant’s personality at the time of the original offending and subsequent to the original offending was grandiose and narcissistic but that more lately the narcissism had subsided and the grandiosity had declined. Evidently, his Honour did not regard that as particularly remarkable. His Honour referred too to character evidence given on the plea and to evidence from the applicant’s business associates as to the importance to them of the work on which the applicant was then engaged. But, as the judge observed, in business as in most else, no one is irreplaceable. His Honour noted as well the hardship and unhappiness that would be caused to the applicant’s family if the applicant were sent to gaol. But, as his Honour said, it was hardly of an exceptional level compared to the sort of hardship suffered by many other families when an offender is imprisoned. Finally, his Honour had regard to the fact that the applicant had complied with his bail conditions while awaiting sentence, but his Honour did not think it significant.<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the applicant argues now that the judge in effect misconceived the nature of “exceptional circumstances” for the purposes of the section and thus or in any event gave too little weight to the factors relied on as establishing exceptional circumstances. Counsel submits that this Court should find that those factors do indeed in aggregate amount to exceptional circumstances and thus that the penalty properly to be imposed for breach of the suspended sentence should be no more than a level 10 fine, or at least should be less than restoration of the whole of the suspended sentence.<br /><strong>The meaning of exceptional circumstances</strong><br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;I do not accept that the sentencing judge misconceived the meaning of “exceptional circumstances” for the purposes of s31(5A). In <em>Owens v Stevens</em>[4], Hedigan J said of the expression “exceptional circumstances” in Clause 15 of Schedule 5 to the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989[5], that:<br />“The use of the phrase ‘exceptional circumstances’ is not unknown in the legal lexicon. Section 13 of the <em>Bail Act </em>is a well-known example. Exceptional is defined, contextually, in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (2nd Edition Volume V), the greatest dictionary, as meaning ‘unusual, special, out of the ordinary course’. This does not mean any variation from the norm.<br />The facts must be examined in the light of the Act, the legislative intention, the interests of the prosecuting authority, the defendant and the victims. It may be that the circumstances amounting to exceptional must be circumstances that rarely occur and perhaps be outside reasonable anticipation or expectation.”[6]<br />The sentencing judge considered that those observations were equally applicable to s31(5A) and, with respect, I agree with his Honour.[7]<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;Before s31(5A) was inserted into the Act by s15(1) of the <em>Sentencing and Other Act (Amendment) Act </em>1997 the position was governed by the former s31(7) of the Act. It provided that the court must restore the whole of the suspended part of the sentence unless of opinion “that it would be unjust to do so in view of all the circumstances which have arisen since the suspended sentence was imposed, including the facts of any subsequent offence”. Under that provision, this Court held in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Newman</em>[8] that it would not be just to restore the suspended sentence in a case where the breaching offence was significantly less serious than the offence for which the suspended sentence had been imposed. Callaway JA, with whom Winneke P agreed, reasoned that it was a matter of balancing the clear legislative policy that, in general, a breach of suspended sentence should result in the offender serving the sentence which was suspended, against the circumstances of the individual offender and the desire not to take a more severe course than is warranted by all the relevant considerations, including the public interest.[9]<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;When, however, the bill for the amending act was read a second time (interestingly on the same day that the decision in Newman was handed down),[10] the Attorney said in her second reading speech:<br />“Suspended sentences<br />Analysis of present sentencing practices indicated that in many cases an offender who has breached a suspended sentence by committing another offence will not be ordered to serve that period of imprisonment by the courts. This state of affairs erodes the effectiveness of this sentencing order and brings the legal system into disrepute.<br />The suspended sentence order is intended to provide an offender with one last chance, yet in practice this has not been the case. The bill amends the provisions to provide that unless there are exceptional circumstances, an offender who has breached a suspended sentence by committing another offence will be imprisoned.”<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;If therefore the language of s31(5A) were not enough in itself to demonstrate an intention to make it harder for offenders to escape the consequences of breaching a suspended sentence, the second reading speech to my mind makes plain[11] that the amendment was intended to have just that effect. Previously, it was enough to avoid restoration of a suspended sentence if, upon the sort of balancing exercise essayed in <em>Newman</em>, it were found that there was good reason in justice and the public interest not to do so. Now, with the requirement of “exceptional circumstances”, it is plain that something more than good reason is required.[12]<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;Like the sentencing judge, I consider that the something more is that if an offender breaches a suspended sentence he or she shall be compelled to serve the whole of the sentence unless the circumstances are so exceptional as to be beyond reasonable contemplation or expectation.<br /><strong>Delay</strong><br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Under the heading of delay, counsel for the applicant makes the point that when the applicant came to be sentenced afresh on 12 September 2005 he was effectively being sentenced for offences that occurred as long ago as 1996 and 1997. The original proceedings in May 2000 were attended by delay and the applicant was not interviewed in relation to the offending against the <em>Corporations Act </em>until March 2003, and not charged with those offences until April 2004. Counsel also points to the fact that although the applicant was sentenced for the <em>Corporations Act</em> offences in June 2004, a warrant was not issued for his arrest in relation to the breach of the suspended sentence until August 2004 and not executed until March 2005. During that period, the applicant had travelled overseas four times and was on his fifth trip when he was arrested.<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;My response to those submissions is much the same as the judge’s response. It is indeed regrettable that there was a delay. Plainly, it is a long time between offending and the final imposition of sentence. But, as the judge said, the applicant has himself been responsible for a good part of that delay. The offending under the <em>Corporations Act </em>continued until January 2003 and it can hardly be said that the applicant reordered his life in the expectation that he would never be held to account for his original offending.[13] To the contrary, knowing that if he offended he stood to be imprisoned, he not only took the risk of offending but did so repeatedly over a period of more than a year and in a manner that was designed to prevent detection. In my view therefore it ill behoves him now to complain that the Crown took another year to catch up with him, or because there was then further delay of the usual and seemingly inevitable proportions in getting the matter on for hearing.<br /><strong>Improved psychological condition</strong><br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;As to the applicant’s so-called improved psychological condition, counsel for the applicant places particular weight on the report of Mr Joblin, which was before the judge, and emphasises Mr Joblin’s observations that:<br />“many of the psychological factors that impinged on [the applicant] and dictated much of the offending for which he appeared in the County Court in 2000 are being resolved”.<br />Mr Joblin opined that the applicant was no longer narcissistic, and that:<br />“it did not seem that the blind grandiosity of the 1990’s and perhaps early 2000’s still predominates his life”.<br />Counsel submits that the fact that Mr Joblin was able to draw those conclusions and to find that the applicant had developed a degree of humility, acknowledged his limitations and was able to learn from his mistakes, are factors which speak well of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation.<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;That may be so, although I share with the judge the view that when Mr&nbsp;Joblin’s report is read as a whole it is not especially favourable. Even if it were, however, I do not consider that it is exceptional for a prisoner to have good prospects of rehabilitation, or at least to have prospects of rehabilitation as good as those suggested by Mr Joblin’s report. One frequently sees far more glowing projections of past and likely improvement; indeed often in reports prepared by Mr&nbsp;Joblin. In any event, to adopt and adapt the words of Hedigan J in <em>Kent v Wilson</em>:[14] “ ... It cannot have been the legislative intention, nor is it the Act’s reasonable construction, that an exceptional circumstance was one that with respect to the relevant offender amounted to no more than a change of lifestyle from abnormal to normal”.<br /><strong>Employment</strong><br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Under the heading of employment, counsel for the applicant emphasised evidence given on the plea by business associates of the applicant as to the importance of the role of the applicant in the affairs of an English company, Virtualplus Ltd, and its proposed backdoor listing on the Australian Stock Exchange. An English director of that company, Mr John Pitcher, gave evidence on the applicant’s behalf in which Mr Pitcher extolled the virtues of the applicant and his commercial acumen and told how the applicant had informed him of his background. A number of other witnesses gave evidence to similar effect. In each instance it was said that the applicant had acted responsibly and without suggestion of seeking to act beyond his role. The judge noted in his sentencing remarks that he found that evidence impressive. Counsel for the applicant further emphasises, as it was emphasised before the sentencing judge, that the business of Virtualplus Ltd was dependent upon the applicant’s expertise and that the success of the business was partially due to this expertise and the applicant’s substantial contribution.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;My reaction to all that, however, is again much the same as the judge’s response. As his Honour put it:<br />"... against that evidence must be balanced my knowledge of your criminal past and my grave concern that despite being given an opportunity you decided very shortly after being sentenced to commit further offences. [Your counsel] referred to the evidence from those particular executives, particularly those involved with Virtual Plus [sic] Limited, and referred to the fact that there were people dependent on your business acumen. However I think there’s a saying that is relevant in all business and in all occupations and it applies here, that no-one’s irreplaceable and I’m quite certain that there must be other people around who can be employed in that position. ..."<br /><strong>Family Considerations<br />23.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the applicant refers to evidence adduced on the plea that the applicant’s mother was to some extent dependent on the applicant. By all accounts he assisted her in saving the matrimonial home and by negotiating a settlement of her own financial predicament brought on by her husband’s bankruptcy. That in turn allowed her to keep her position as an insurance agent and to support her two younger children. The applicant also supported her financially.<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, however, all of that is largely irrelevant for present purposes. It is to be expected, or at least hoped, that someone in the applicant’s position would do his best to look after his mother in need. I find it impossible to regard the applicant’s doing so as amounting to an exceptional circumstance for present purposes.<br /><strong>Character evidence and conduct on bail</strong><br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the applicant emphasises the large number of character witnesses who gave evidence at the sentencing hearing and also evidence that the applicant has strong family support. The judge regarded that evidence as impressive. But, again, it is just not the sort of thing which amounts to exceptional circumstances for the purposes of s31(5A). Previous good character, a good work record and a supportive family rarely, if ever, amount to exceptional circumstances for bail purposes.[15] In the scheme of things, in my view, it is even less likely that things of that sort should amount to exceptional circumstances for deciding whether to restore a suspended sentence of imprisonment.<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel refers as well to the applicant’s conduct whilst on bail awaiting sentence, including that on two occasions he was allowed bail variations in order to travel overseas and that he complied with them to the letter. Like the judge, I think that largely to be irrelevant.<br /><strong>Conduct in relation to the breaching offences<br />27.</strong>&nbsp;Finally, counsel for the applicant invokes the decision of this Court in <em>Newman</em> as authority for the proposition that disproportion between the seriousness of a breaching offence and the sentence of imprisonment proposed to be activated is an important consideration in determining whether to restore the suspended sentence. He argues that while the <em>Corporations Act </em>offences carried possible terms of imprisonment, the fact that the applicant was fined only $5,000 was indicative of the relatively insignificant nature of the offences. As counsel puts it, the fines imposed indicate that the offending was at the lower end of the scale of seriousness, and he submits that the disproportion between offending of that kind and the restoration of the suspended term of imprisonment is so great as to constitute an exceptional circumstance, at least when taken in conjunction with the other factors which he mentioned.<br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;I regret I do not agree. Like the judge, I consider that the magistrate was particularly lenient. The breaching offences were calculated and devious and reflected dishonesty of much the same kind[16] as led to the offences for which the suspended sentence was imposed. As appears from the prosecutor’s statement of facts at the sentencing hearing, despite that the applicant was prohibited by law from acting as a director or being involved in the management of a company, and although he knew that to be the case, he acted as a director of Stegtel Trade and Equities Pty Ltd between September 2000 and February 2001; he acted in a management role at Broadband and Wireless Pty Ltd between July 2001 and 31 January 2003; and, during 2001, he lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission three notification of change of office holder forms, in relation to three separate companies, appointing himself as a director of each company, using aliases and false details of birth to conceal the fact that it was he. When Callaway JA spoke in <em>Newman </em>of disparity between the offending for which the suspended sentence had been imposed and the breaching office, his Honour was dealing with a case in which the offender had been given a total effective sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment, of which 10 months was suspended for two years, for offences of aggravated burglary and intentionally damaging property. The breaching offence was limited to the offender throwing a rock through the windscreen of his girlfriend’s car during a domestic dispute, and that offence was provoked by the offender’s girlfriend smashing the windscreen and puncturing the bonnet of the offender’s car. With respect, I can well understand why his Honour regarded disparity as an important consideration in such a case, and thus how his Honour came to the conclusion that it was in the interests of justice to be lenient. But, as it seems to me, all of that is a world away from a case like this one. Here the applicant was sentenced to 25 months’ imprisonment for serious offences of dishonesty, and here, having been given the “last chance” for which s27 provides, the applicant was so little appreciative of the opportunity thereby afforded to him that he almost immediately began again, and for the next two years he continued, to engage in acts of continuing criminal dishonesty. So far from the nature of the breaching offences in this case being an exceptional circumstance warranting an amelioration of the restoration of the suspended sentence, it strengthens me in the view that full restoration of the suspended sentence is just what is required.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong><br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;In the result, I would dismiss the application for leave.<br /><strong>BUCHANAN JA: </strong><br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;I agree.<br /><strong>EAMES JA: </strong><br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;I also agree.<br /><strong>BUCHANAN JA: </strong><br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;The order of the Court will be that the application for leave to appeal against sentence is refused.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] <em>Corporations Act </em>2001, s1311(3) and Schedule 3, Item 49.<br />[2] <em>Corporations Act </em>2001, s1311(3) and Schedule 3, Item 335.<br />[3] <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991, s31(1).<br />[4] Unreported, 3 May 1991.<br />[5] Which, broadly speaking, permitted the court to authorise the commencement of a committal proceeding more than three months after commencement of the commencement of the proceeding for an offence if satisfied that there were “exceptional circumstances”.<br />[6] See also <em>Schwerin v Equal Opportunity Board </em>[1994] 2 VR 279 at 287-288, per McDonald J; <em>R v McLachlan </em>[1999] 2 VR 665 at 669, per Chernov JA; <em>Kent v Wilson </em>[2000] VSC 98 at [20]-[40] per Hedigan J.<br />[7] See also the observations of Dodds-Streeton J in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Maxwell </em>[2005] VSC 430 at [70]-[98].<br />[8] [1999] 1 VR 715.<br />[9] Ibid. at 715, with which Winneke P agreed.<br />[10] 24 April 1997.<br />[11] Pursuant to s35A of the <em>Interpretation of Legislation Act </em>1984.<br />[12] Cf. <em>Irving v Carbines </em>[1982] VR 861 at 865.<br />[13] See and compare, in the analogous context of the effect of delay on sentencing, <em>R v Nikodjevic </em>[2004] VSCA 222 at [20]-[24], per Ormiston JA.<br />[14] [2000] VSC 98 at [29].<br />[15] <em>R v Hanna El Rahi</em>, Unreported 18/1/96, Beach J; <em>Kent v Wilson </em>[2000] VSC 98 at [40].<br />[16] cf <em>R v Snip </em>[2000] VSC 205 at [7] per Hampel J.<br /><strong>APPEARANCES: </strong>For the Crown: Mrs CM Quin, counsel.

In other words, the undertakings given by both the accused and the surety are self-executing and the Court is obliged to make the declaration and the orders. S6(1) of the <em>Crown Proceedings Act </em>1958 (Act) requires the Court to make the declaration and the orders once it is satisfied that a person has failed to observe a condition of the bail. The Court has a discretion to allow time to pay and the period of imprisonment in default is a matter of discretion.<br /></strong><strong>2.&nbsp;The law demands that notice be given to a party before any order is made affecting the interests or rights of the party, and although it is clear that in certain circumstances an application may be made ex parte, the general rule should be that notice should be given unless, of course, there are circumstances justifying an order being made ex parte. Orders made under s6(1) are fairly draconian and even though s6(4) enables the surety to return to court to contest any declaration or order made, as a general rule, notice should be given to the surety before an order is made under s6(1). This is because there are matters of some importance which a surety should be permitted to contest or make submissions in relation to, before orders are made against him or her. There is no doubt that any order made affects a surety’s rights and interests. The surety may place evidence before the Court which requires further investigation before the Court hears the application. It is apparent from s6(3) that an order could be made ex parte and there may be circumstances which would require that course to be taken. For example, the surety’s whereabouts are unknown or there is good reason why the order should be made in his or her absence. The Court, in order to protect the Crown’s position, can use its power to grant an injunction to preserve a situation until the hearing. A surety must have the opportunity to be heard on a number of issues which affect his or her interests.<br /></strong><strong>3.&nbsp;On one view of s6(1) of the Act, all the Crown has to prove is that the accused failed to attend and hence is in breach of a condition of bail. On the other hand, another interpretation would be that a person does not fail to observe a condition of bail unless the failure is the result of a deliberate act on the part of that person. In other words, there must be an element of fault. Accordingly, if an accused person was killed or injured and hence could not attend court, or was detained against his will, it could not be said that he failed to observe a condition of the bail. What the Crown has to prove is a question of interpretation of the phrase "a person has failed to observe a condition of bail". What does the phrase "has failed" mean in the context of the section and the Act?<br /></strong><strong>4.&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Court must be satisfied of the proof of a fact, namely, that an accused has failed to observe a condition of bail. Like any other fact, it must be proven to the satisfaction of the Court and the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities. As a general rule of law the law is concerned with proof of fault before an adverse order is made. There are exceptions but the law does not compel the impossible. If proof of fault was necessary, the quantum of proof will depend upon the circumstances of each case. In most cases the mere failure to attend may be sufficient. The surrounding circumstances may very quickly establish that it was a deliberate act.<br /></strong><strong>5.&nbsp;In the event of failure by a surety to pay the sum ordered to be forfeited, the Court is empowered to imprison the surety for a term not exceeding two years. As a general rule, the greater the sum the longer the period of imprisonment. The period of imprisonment in default of payment must be commensurate with the amount of the undertaking. Whilst the period of two years imprisonment is an inadequate period when the undertaking to pay a sum fixed as high as $1 million, in the present case the Court fixed the period of two years imprisonment in the event of default.&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>GILLARD J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;These are applications by the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth and the Crown in the right of the State, for declarations that the bail granted to the prisoner be forfeited and for orders that the amount undertaken by the surety in each of two proceedings be paid to the Court forthwith.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The prisoner, Antonios Sajih Mokbel ("the prisoner"), was arrested on 24 August 2001 and charged with the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of a prohibited import, namely narcotic goods consisting of not less than a traffickable quantity of cocaine, which arrived in Australia on 6 November 2000, contrary to paragraph 233B(1)(d) of the <em>Customs Act </em>1901. Upon arrest, he was remanded in custody and on 7 September 2001, he was granted bail by a magistrate on a number of strict conditions. The Crown appealed against the grant of bail and Cummins J, on 1 October 2001, allowed the appeal and the prisoner was remanded in custody. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;During 2002 the prisoner made a number of applications to this Court for bail. Kellam J heard two applications for bail, and on the second occasion his Honour observed that there was a real possibility of inordinate delay occurring before the hearing of the committal proceeding and that in those circumstances the prisoner may establish exceptional circumstances. His Honour put the Crown on notice that the stage may be reached that the delay would result in the grant of bail. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to the Commonwealth charge, the prisoner was charged by the State Police on 24 August 2001 with a number of serious charges relating to the trafficking of drugs in a commercial quantity. He was arrested as a result of those charges and remanded in custody. The applications for bail in 2002 were in respect to both the Commonwealth and State charges. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;On 4 September 2002, Kellam J granted the prisoner bail having been satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances because of the indefinite delay. The conditions were onerous. A surety of $1 million was required. The accused was required to report twice daily to a local police station. The delay in holding the committal in both proceedings was because some members of the former Victorian Drug Squad, who were to be witnesses in both proceedings, were under investigation in respect to allegations of corruption.[1] His Honour fixed a surety in the same sum in respect of the bail granted in both sets of charges, and noted that there was one surety, namely Mrs Renate Mokbel, who was joint surety in respect to both prosecutions. The amount of the undertakings was therefore $1 million total for both proceedings. Whilst each set of charges was treated separately for the purposes of bail and was the subject of separate orders, it has been accepted by both the Commonwealth and State DPPs that the present applications deal with one person, who is the surety in each case and who undertook to pay a total sum of $1 million in respect to both proceedings. Accordingly, if orders are made in each proceeding, the total sum to be paid is $1 million and the default provision in respect to imprisonment is up to two years. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;There was an inordinate delay between 4 September 2002 and the committals. The Commonwealth committal took place in November 2004. Up to that time, the prisoner had complied with the strict conditions imposed by the order granting bail. He honoured his bail undertaking by appearing at the committal proceeding. On 26 November 2004, a magistrate committed the prisoner for trial and bail was again fixed subject to strict conditions. The magistrate required the prisoner to attend the Supreme Court at Melbourne on 1 March 2005 or as otherwise directed by the Court, on his own undertaking, and with one surety in the sum of $1 million. He was to reside at certain premises in Southgate, was bound to surrender any passport he held, was bound not to attend at any point of international departure, and not to make contact with any witness. He was bound to report each Monday, Wednesday and Friday at a local police station. On that day, the prisoner signed an undertaking of bail for appearance at trial and the surety, Mrs Renate Lisa Mokbel of 11 Downs Street, Brunswick, signed the undertaking as surety. She is the prisoner’s sister-in-law, being the wife of his brother. She also swore on that day an Affidavit of Justification by Surety to Undertaking, and a number of documents were supplied to the Registrar of the Magistrates’ Court purporting to show her interest in a piece of real estate at 11 Downs Street, Brunswick. The order for bail was extended from time to time. On 24 August 2005, I fixed the trial date for 26 October 2005 and ordered that the accused was to continue on bail on the same conditions until that date. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The committal in respect of the State charges was heard at the beginning of 2005 and on 15 February 2005 the prisoner was committed for trial on three counts of trafficking in drugs. The magistrate released him on bail, conditioned to appear before the Supreme Court at Melbourne on 3 May 2005, with one surety of $1 million and subject to a number of conditions. This bail was also extended from time to time. In the course of the directions hearings conducted by me in mid to late 2005, it was agreed between the Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) and the prisoner’s lawyers that the State trial should take place after the completion of the Commonwealth trial. During 2005, it was stated from time to time by counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions (Victoria) that it was anticipated that the prisoner would plead guilty to three counts of trafficking in a drug of dependence. Despite these indications, counsel for the prisoner did not commit the prisoner to a plea of guilty, but observations were made suggesting that he would plead guilty to the three charges. On 29 March 2006, the DPP (Victoria) filed a presentment in the Court alleging three counts of trafficking in a drug of dependence during the period between 13 October 2000 and 27 December 2000. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;In October 2005, the prisoner was charged by the Commonwealth police with a number of additional drug charges. He was remanded in custody and a magistrate on 23 November 2005 released the prisoner on bail in respect of those charges. In the meantime, the prisoner honoured his obligation to attend the Supreme Court on the date of the trial, namely 26 October 2005, although it has to be said that he was, at that stage, in custody in relation to the additional Commonwealth charges. I remanded him in custody. I had earlier vacated the trial date and fixed 1 February 2006 for the hearing of the Commonwealth charge. The State charges were adjourned to that date. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;As the prisoner had answered his bail on 26 October 2005, application was made to extend the existing bail, which I heard on 29 November 2005. By this date, a magistrate had ordered that the prisoner be admitted to bail in respect of the new Commonwealth charges. I extended bail in the Commonwealth proceeding on conditions, namely, that the prisoner attend at the Supreme Court of Victoria on 1 February 2006, reside at a certain address, report twice daily to the officer in charge at the South Melbourne Police Station, not contact directly or indirectly any Crown witness, surrender any passports and not seek to obtain one, not attend at any point of international departure, and not contact the four men involved in the importation. The Court also imposed a curfew between 10.00pm and 7.00am each night. He was bailed on his own undertaking with one surety in the sum of $1 million.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The bail in relation to the State charges was also extended on the same conditions. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;On that day, the prisoner attended before the Deputy Prothonotary of this Court, and signed the undertaking of bail, and the surety Mrs Mokbel signed the document acknowledging receipt of the notice setting out the obligations of the prisoner concerning the conditions of his bail and the consequences of his failure to comply with the conditions. She further undertook "to pay to the Prothonotary the amount of bail specified on the back of this form in the event that the defendant fails to observe a condition of bail". The undertaking of bail was that she would pay the amount of $1 million. The undertaking was signed in relation to both the Commonwealth proceeding and the State proceeding. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;The trial was mentioned on 31 January 2006 and was adjourned to 7 February 2006 at the request of defence counsel. The prisoner attended the hearings. Bail was continued on the same conditions, until further order. The jury was empanelled on Monday, 13 February 2006 and the trial commenced. The prisoner had for a period in excess of three years and four months complied with the conditions of bail and had attended every Court hearing. The continuation of bail at the commencement of the trial is the usual order absent any application to revoke the bail. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The Crown called some fifty witnesses and the defence called three. The prisoner did not give evidence. At the end of the Crown case, a submission of no case was made on behalf of the prisoner. The application was rejected. During the course of the defence case, a late application was made to adduce evidence concerning the effect of the law of the United States of America on the passage of the parcels containing the cocaine through that country. The defence failed to persuade the Court of what was the relevant American law at the time. Despite this, an application was made at the end of the defence case that the jury be directed to acquit the accused. That application also failed. The defence case closed on Thursday, 16 March 2006, and the prosecutor, Mr D. Parsons SC commenced his address. The following day, application was made by the Crown to revoke the prisoner’s bail. The Crown did not place any material before the Court in support of the application, other than to observe that the Crown case was a strong one. After hearing submissions, the Court stated that bail would be revoked at the end of counsel’s addresses. This was anticipated to be the following Tuesday. Friday, 17 March 2006 was the twenty eighth day of the trial, and the prisoner had strictly complied with all conditions of his bail. Nothing was placed before the Court to suggest that he would not continue to honour his undertaking. There is no fixed practice as to when bail should be revoked during the course of a criminal trial. The question is left to the discretion of the presiding judge. Experience shows that the revocation could take place at any time from the end of the Crown case up to verdict. I interpolate to observe that since the verdict, the Court has been apprised of a number of matters which were relevant to the question of bail continuing. I refer in particular to the revelation that the Victorian Police were investigating Mr Mokbel’s alleged involvement in a "Gangland" murder and had made a decision to arrest him in respect to the crime. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;On the morning of Monday, 20 March 2006, the Court was informed at 10.30am that the prisoner was missing and had not been seen since 5.00pm the previous evening, when he reported to the South Melbourne Police Station. On that day, a warrant to arrest the prisoner was issued by the Court. The trial continued and on 28 March 2006, the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. The Court sentenced the prisoner on 31 March 2006 to 12 years’ gaol and fixed a minimum period of nine years before the prisoner was eligible for parole. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;In the meantime, the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth applied for a declaration and orders pursuant to s6(1) of the <em>Crown Proceedings Act </em>1958 ("the Act"), and on 24 March 2006 the application was adjourned until the following Wednesday, 29 March 2006. The Court granted an injunction restraining the surety from in any way dealing with her real estate or the shares in a company called J.R. Mokbel Pty Ltd. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;On 29 March 2006, the Crown in the right of the State of Victoria filed a presentment in the Court in relation to the three State charges and the Court ordered, pursuant to s26(2) of the <em>Bail Act </em>1977, that a warrant be issued for the apprehension of the prisoner. The Crown in the right of the State of Victoria also sought an order against the surety pursuant to s6(1) of the Act. Both applications were adjourned to 19 April 2006. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Section 6 of the Act provides for a two hearing process. The first hearing pursuant to s6(1) requires the Crown to prove that the accused person failed to observe a condition of bail. Once that is proven, certain consequences follow by reason of the provisions of the sub-section. It provides:<br />"(1) Where a court is satisfied that a person has failed to observe a condition of bail the court shall declare the bail to be forfeited and shall order that the amount undertaken by the surety or sureties to be paid to Her Majesty in the event of such a breach be paid to the proper officer of the court forthwith or within such time as the court allows and that in default of payment of that amount in accordance with the order that the amount be obtained by seizing and selling the property of the surety or sureties and in default, in whole or in part, that the surety or sureties be imprisoned for the term (not exceeding two years) fixed by the order."<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;If the Court is satisfied of the failure to observe the condition of bail, then the Court shall—<br />(i) declare the bail to be forfeited <br />(ii) order that the amount undertaken by the surety be paid to Her Majesty by payment to an officer of this Court forthwith or within such time as the Court allows; <br />(iii) that in default of payment of that amount it be obtained by seizing and selling the property of the surety; and <br />(iv) in default in whole or in part that the surety be imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years fixed by order. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, once the Court is satisfied that an accused person has failed to observe a condition of bail, the Court is bound to declare that the bail be forfeited, and order that the surety pay the amount undertaken, that in default payment can be exacted by seizing and selling the property of the surety, and that in default in whole or in part, the surety be imprisoned for a term not exceeding two years. In other words, the undertakings given by both the accused and the surety are self-executing and the Court is obliged to make the declaration and the orders. In <em>R v Baker</em>,[2] Gowans J, dealing with the then s5 of the Act as amended, held that the Court was obliged to make the necessary orders in accordance with the provisions of the section. His Honour held that he had no discretion in the matter and was obliged to make the orders under the section. In my opinion, s6(1) requires the Court to make the declaration and the orders once it is satisfied that a person has failed to observe a condition of the bail, although the Court has a discretion to allow time to pay, and further the period of imprisonment in default is a matter of discretion. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;The second hearing is found in s6(4) of the Act. The sub-section permits a surety, within a 28 days’ period after the order is made or brought to the surety’s attention, to apply to the Court "to vary or rescind the order on the ground it would be unjust to require him to pay the amount undertaken to be paid having regard to all the circumstances of the case". The Court may vary or rescind any order made. Mr Lasry QC, who appeared for Mrs Mokbel, informed the Court that in the event of orders being made under s6(1), his client would make an application to the Court pursuant to that sub-section. The applicable principles were discussed in <em>Re Condon</em>[3] and <em>Re Melincianu</em>.[4]<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Regulations have been made under the Act which prescribe the forms to be used in respect of forfeited recognizances and breach of bail. See <em>Crown Proceedings Regulations </em>2002 SR No.2/2002. Regulations have also been made under the Bail Act 1977 which prescribe the forms to be used for the purposes of the <em>Bail Act </em>1977 – see Bail Regulations 2003 (No. 1 of 2003). There were earlier Regulations – see <em>Bail Regulations </em>1992 No. 177.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;The Court required the Crown in both applications to give notice to the surety of the applications made pursuant to s6(1). The surety has been represented throughout by solicitors, and Mr Lasry has appeared on her behalf at the hearings. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Orders made under s6(1) are fairly draconian and even though s6(4) enables the surety to return to court to contest any declaration or order made, in my opinion, as a general rule, notice should be given to the surety before an order is made under s6(1). I say that because there are matters of some importance which a surety should be permitted to contest or make submissions in relation to, before orders are made against him or her. There is no doubt that any order made affects a surety’s rights and interests. The first matter is whether the Court is satisfied that the accused person has failed to observe a condition of bail. The second matter is the period of imprisonment, if declarations and orders are made, and whether the surety should be given any time in order to pay the amount of the undertaking, and if so, what amount of time. Finally, and importantly, the Court must consider whether the application should be adjourned to enable further investigation to be carried out. The surety may place evidence before the Court which requires further investigation before the Court hears the application. It is apparent from s6(3) that an order could be made ex parte and there may be circumstances which would require that course to be taken. For example, the surety’s whereabouts are unknown or there is good reason why the order should be made in his or her absence. The Court, in order to protect the Crown’s position, can use its power to grant an injunction to preserve a situation until the hearing.<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;The law demands that notice be given to a party before any order is made affecting the interests or rights of the party, and although it is clear that in certain circumstances an application may be made ex parte, in my view the general rule should be that notice should be given unless, of course, there are circumstances justifying an order being made ex parte. The Full Court in <em>O’Sullivan v Long</em>[5] held that a surety should not be judged to pay the sum of the surety or to be subject to a warrant of distress until the person was given opportunity to be heard. In that case, the Court was dealing with s16 of the <em>Justices Act </em>1915. The Court noted that the decision was not in accordance with the practice which had been followed for many years, and that it also could cause considerable inconvenience in the lower court, but as the learned Chief Justice said:<br />"That is a matter with which Parliament can deal if it is desired."<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;I do not believe that inconvenience will result if notice has to be given and the interests of the Crown can be protected by an interlocutory injunction. A surety must have the opportunity to be heard on a number of issues which affect his or her interests. <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;The Court raised the question: What does the Crown have to prove before the declaration and orders are made under s6(1)? On a literal interpretation of the sub-section, the mere failure to attend at court would invoke the jurisdiction to declare that the bail be forfeited and an order that the surety pay the amount to the proper officer of this Court. Indeed, that may have been the approach taken by Crockett J in <em>Re Condon</em>.[6] In that case, the accused failed to answer a charge of armed robbery and Crockett J ordered the surety to pay the sum of $5,000 and in default of distress, imprisonment for 12 months. Application was then made on behalf of the surety to vary or rescind the amount pursuant to the then equivalent of s6(4). His Honour,[7] having dismissed the application, observed that the reason why the accused failed to answer his bail may have been due to him being murdered. His Honour observed that the material which he had looked at indicated "that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that such a fate may have befallen Garry and his non-attendance at Court would possibly be due to his untimely death." His Honour noted that if later it was ascertained that that was so, it would be a basis for setting aside the order he had earlier made dismissing the application for relief, but by then it would be too late. His Honour was assured by counsel for the Crown that there would be a gratuitous refund of the forfeited security if that was the position, although his Honour’s order could not be set aside. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;It is not possible to ascertain from the report of his Honour’s reasons, that he was aware of the possibility of the accused person dying when he made the order forfeiting the security at the first hearing. It is open to infer that the information suggesting an untimely death was placed before the Court on the second application. His Honour adverted to the question of adjourning the second hearing but declined to do so in the circumstances. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;On one view of s6(1), all the Crown has to prove is that the accused failed to attend and hence was in breach of a condition of bail. On the other hand, another interpretation would be that a person does not fail to observe a condition of bail unless the failure is the result of a deliberate act on the part of that person. In other words, there must be an element of fault. Accordingly, if an accused person was killed or injured and hence could not attend court, or was detained against his will, it could not be said that he failed to observe a condition of the bail. What the Crown has to prove, in my opinion, is a question of interpretation of the phrase "a person has failed to observe a condition of bail". What does the phrase "has failed" mean in the context of the section and the Act? <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Court must be satisfied of the proof of a fact, namely, that an accused has failed to observe a condition of bail. Like any other fact, it must be proven to the satisfaction of the Court. <br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>The King v Frank Smith</em>,[8] the defendant was convicted of stealing a motor car and was discharged conditionally upon entering into a recognizance of £50 to be of good behaviour for two years. Some months later the defendant was brought up for sentence on an allegation that he had broken his recognizance. On appeal an issue arose whether it had been proven that he had broken his recognizance. The Court said:[9]<br />"Where a defendant is brought up on an allegation that he has broken his recognizance, he cannot properly be sentenced unless the allegation of fact is proved, and it must be proved as any other allegation of fact is proved in a criminal court. It must be supported by the sworn evidence of witnesses for the prosecution and the defendant must be allowed to cross-examine these witnesses and also give evidence himself and to call witnesses to give evidence on his behalf."<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, the Crown has to prove that the accused has failed to observe a condition of bail, and that fact has to be proven like any other fact in a proceeding. It is noted that the Court in the Smith case appeared to state that the standard of proof was beyond reasonable doubt. In the later case of <em>R v Marlow JJ ex. p. O’Sullivan</em>,[10] the Court held that where it was alleged that there was a failure to fulfil a recognizance his safety;<br />• Enquiries of a variety of informers, including registered informers, did not disclose any information that the prisoner had been murdered or was being held against his will; <br />• Information was received that the prisoner had transferred quantities of cash in the order of $20 million overseas in the past three years and that he was in possession of a number of false passports;<br />• Further information gathered by the Australian Federal Police leads to the conclusion that the prisoner is residing in an overseas country, which is known to the police but which, at this stage, is not disclosed, and that he departed Australia unlawfully during a period of approximately 14 days after 20 March 2006;<br />• It was the opinion of senior officers of Victoria Police that if the prisoner had been the victim of a "Gangland" killing his body would have been found shortly after his murder;<br />• The prisoner had been named by an informant as being involved in a contract "Gangland" murder, and a statement to that effect had been made available to the prisoner. It is believed that the prisoner was aware of the contents of the statement on Tuesday, 14 March 2006 and that he believed he was about to be arrested by Victorian police;<br />• That Australian Federal Police were told on Friday, 17 March 2006 that Victorian police proposed to arrest the prisoner and charge him with being involved in the murder.<br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;I am satisfied that the Crown has proven on the balance of probabilities that the prisoner, Antonios Mokbel, failed to observe a condition of bail by absconding and failing to attend the trial on Monday, 20 March 2006. It follows that the Court must order that the $1 million undertaken to be paid by the surety, Mrs Mokbel, be paid to an officer of this Court. The Court has power to give time to pay and it seems appropriate in the circumstances, bearing in mind that the surety’s assets comprise her residential property, that she be given time to pay the amount. According to the Affidavit of Justification by the surety, she has real estate consisting of a dwelling house at 11 Downs Street, Brunswick, and it has a value in excess of $1 million. The evidence attached to that affidavit reveals that the property is registered in the name of a company called J.R. Mokbel Pty Ltd. The surety is the sole director and shareholder of that company. Mr Lasry has informed the Court that if an order is made under s6(1) then the surety will make an application under s6(4), and that application must be made within 28 days of the making of the order. By reason of s6(6), the surety is obliged not less than 28 days before the hearing of the application to serve on a person a true copy of the application. Section 6(7) empowers the Court to stay the operation of the order made. I propose in the circumstances to grant her 31 days in which to pay the said sum. This will enable her to make application within 28 days and to apply for a stay. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;That then brings me to the question of the period of imprisonment in the event of Mrs Mokbel failing to pay the $1 million. The Court is empowered to imprison the surety for a term not exceeding two years. <br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;The criminal justice system in this country dates back to the First Fleet. Our early settlers brought with them a criminal justice system that went back many centuries in England. A feature of the English criminal justice system was the right of an accused to be released on bail pending his or her trial. In cases of treason, bail could only be granted by the Secretary of State or a judge of the King’s Bench Division, but in felony cases it was a matter for the local justices’ discretion. In relation to misdemeanours, the justices did not have a discretion when the preliminary examination was completed, and were bound to release the accused upon the latter finding adequate bail. Indeed, the <em>Bill of Rights </em>of 1689 provided that excessive bail was not permitted, that is, that the conditions of bail should not be set to deter the release of the accused pending trial. The right to bail goes back in English and Australian law for centuries. The right is enshrined in s4(1) of the <em>Bail Act </em>1977. <br /><strong>45.</strong>&nbsp;An important and essential part of the bail system was the provision of a surety. The surety undertakes to ensure that the accused appears at his trial. That is the prime obligation. The procedure of releasing a person into the custody of a surety goes back over many hundreds of years. In 2 <em>Hawkins Pleas of the Crown</em>, Chapter 15, s3, the learned author stated the effect of granting bail, namely, that it was not to set the accused free but to release him from the custody of the law and to entrust him to the custody of his sureties, who were bound to produce him to answer on his trial at a specified time and place. <br /><strong>46.</strong>&nbsp;As stated, the right to bail has been recognised from time immemorial. In <em>The Queen v Badger</em>[17] Lord Denman CJ said:[18]<br />"The law is clear, and is as old as the statute of Westminster the First, 3 ed. 1 c 15. Lord Coke in his commentary upon that statute (2 Inst 191) says that ‘to deny a man plevin that is plevisable, and thereby to detain him in prison, is a great offence, and grievously to be punished’. And Lord Hale in 2 Pl Cr p.135 Part II, c 15 adopts the same remark: ‘and Hawkins (Part 2, c 15, s 13(b) speaks of refusals of bail as an indictable offence. Blackstone referring (4 Com c 22, p.297) to the ancient statutes, the Habeas Corpus and Bill of Rights, calls it ‘an offence against the liberty of the subject.’ If then, such refusal took place from improper motives, it might be treated as a criminal offence and made subject to an indictment information."<br /><strong>47.</strong>&nbsp;Although an accused had a right to obtain bail, it was a matter for the person to whom application was made to determine whether or not bail should be granted, and if so, on what condition. In considering the question, the prime consideration was whether there was a likelihood of the accused failing to appear at his trial. Relevant to that exercise was the gravity of the charge, the strength of the case against the accused, and the financial position of the accused. Further, the likelihood that the accused may attempt to interfere with witnesses. But what was vital to the whole exercise was the availability of a person or persons who were prepared to act as surety for the accused. In respect to a surety, it was necessary to consider whether the surety was independent of the accused and understood and appreciated his or her obligations. <br /><strong>48.</strong>&nbsp;The word "bail" has two meanings. One meaning is the temporary relief from imprisonment on finding sureties or security to appear for trial. This is the modern meaning. This goes back to 1768. But the second meaning is the security so given, that is, the person or persons who became sureties. This is traceable back to 1495. See <em>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</em>. <br /><strong>49.</strong>&nbsp;The learned authors Pollock and Maitland, in <em>History of English Law</em>, Volume 2, at p585, summarised the position in England prior to 1275 as follows:<br />"The law was gradually growing less favourable to release. In one passage Bracton repeats Glanvill’s words:- ‘if a man has been appealed or indicted of any felony, other than homicide, he is usually replevied.’ In another passage we find a far severer doctrine:- ‘the man who has been taken for high treason is absolutely irreplevisable; the man who has been taken for any crime which is punished by death or mutilation will hardly be able to exhort from the King the privilege of being released on bail.’ The records of practice seem to show that some sheriffs were only too glad to dismiss prisoners from custody. Then in 1275 one of Edward I’s momentous statutes, after accusing the sheriffs both of retaining those who were, and releasing those who were not, replevisable, and after admitting that the law about this matter had never been precisely determined, proceeded to lay down rules which correspond rather with Bracton’s severer doctrine than those with his more lenient doctrine, and these statutory rules became the law for the coming centuries."<br /><strong>50.</strong>&nbsp;Sureties were very important to the granting of bail. Early English law pointed to an ancient and extremely rigorous form of suretyship, which rendered the surety liable to suffer the punishment that was hanging over the head of the released accused if the accused failed to attend. And although in the early days the undertaking to forfeit a sum was indeed rare, in later centuries it became the norm. See ibid at pp589-90. <br /><strong>51.</strong>&nbsp;The right to bail has continued throughout the centuries. The ancient right was recently restated by the Privy Council in <em>Hurnam v State of Mauritius</em>.[19] In that case, their Lordships referred to the jurisprudence on the European Convention "which recognises that the right to personal liberty though not absolute ... is nonetheless a right that is at the heart of all political systems that purport to abide by the rule of law and protects the individual against arbitrary detention. The European Court has clearly recognised five grounds for refusing bail (the risk of the defendant absconding; the risk of the defendant interfering with the course of justice; preventing crime; preserving public order; and the necessity of detention to protect the defendant; ... but it has insisted that a person must be released unless the State can show that there are ‘relevant and sufficient reasons’ to justify his continued detention. ... As put by the Law Commission in its report paragraph 2.28 ‘Detention will be found to be justified only if it was necessary in pursuit of a legitimate purpose or ground’." <br /><strong>52.</strong>&nbsp;There is always a risk when a person is granted bail pending a trial, or where bail is continued in the course of a trial, that the accused may abscond. Every week in this State, many persons are given bail subject to conditions which vary from case to case. Sometimes bail is granted on the undertaking of the accused person himself or herself, or on the undertaking of the accused and that of a surety or sureties. The object of imposing conditions is to minimise the risk that the accused person will abscond. The greater the risk, the stricter of conditions.<br /><strong>53.</strong>&nbsp;In this case, the prisoner was granted bail in respect to two separate criminal proceedings. Conditions were imposed. One was the requirement of a surety in the sum of $1 million. The importance of the undertaking by the surety cannot be overstated. The Court, once it grants bail, is not in a position to supervise obedience to the order and conditions. It relies upon a surety or sureties to perform that task. In that sense, the surety acts as both the eyes and ears of the Court. The surety undertakes the duty to ensure that the principal, that is, the accused, honours his undertaking to the Court to appear at trial and to attend each day of the trial. The obligation was stated by Lord Alverstone CJ, speaking for the Court in <em>The Queen v Porter</em>,[20] when his Lordship said:<br />"It is in the interests of the public that criminals should be brought to justice, and, therefore, that it should be made as difficult as possible for a criminal to abscond; and for many years it has been held that not only are [sureties] responsible on their recognizance for the due appearance of the person charged, but that, if it comes to their knowledge that he is about to abscond, they should at once inform the police of that fact."<br /><strong>54.</strong>&nbsp;Section 9 of the <em>Bail Act </em>1977 deals with sureties. Section 5 of the <em>Bail Act </em>1977 deals with conditions of release on bail. Section 5(1) obliges the Court to consider the release of an accused person on bail in a particular sequence, and concludes that the Court "shall not make the conditions for his entry into bail any more onerous for the accused person than the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the accused person appeared to the Court to be required in the public interest." This adopts the requirement of the ancient Bill of Rights. A surety must be at least 18 years of age, must not under any disability and must be worth not less than the amount of the bail. Under s21, where a surety fears the accused will not appear, the surety may apprehend the person bailed and take steps to bring him or her before a court. Under s23, a surety may seek to be discharged from liability as a surety. <br /><strong>55.</strong>&nbsp;The surety must be independent and undertake a real obligation. This means that the surety must put his or her money at risk. Hence, by reason of s31 of the <em>Bail Act</em>, it is a criminal offence for a person to indemnify a surety, and an agreement by which an accused undertakes to indemnify a surety constitutes a conspiracy to effect a public mischief.[21] It is vital that a surety understands the obligation of his or her undertaking, and the obligation requires the surety to ensure that the accused honours his or her undertaking to attend the trial. <br /><strong>56.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to the undertaking given by the surety, the amount of the undertaking is fixed to provide a disincentive to the accused to abscond. The amount of the surety exerts a pressure on the accused to honour his undertaking. It was described as "the rto keep the peace, the procedure for forfeiture was begun by a complaint and was a civil process, and accordingly the standard was on the balance of probabilities. In my opinion, the present proceeding is analogous to a civil proceeding and this is clear from the fact that Part I of the Act is concerned with the recovery of debts and property by the Crown. Further, by reason of s18, Her Majesty is entitled to full costs in all cases in which "a plaintiff in any civil proceeding between subject and subject would be entitled thereto". Mr Lasry did not submit to the contrary and indeed conceded that the standard of proof would be on the balance of probabilities. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;The word "failed", like so many words of our language, has a variety of meanings which depend upon the context in which it is used. A person bailed is obliged to comply with the terms of the bail, the most important of which is to attend at the place and on the date specified. The conditions of the undertaking in this case are that the accused must appear on the date specified at a time before the Supreme Court of Victoria at Melbourne and then surrender himself and not depart without leave of the Court, and as often as leave is given, return at the time appointed by the Court and again surrender himself.[11] The word "failure", depending on the context, may mean that a person does not fail to observe a condition unless that person has a capacity to comply with the condition. As a matter of common sense, it could hardly be said that a person failed to attend at a particular place on a particular date if that person was dead.<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Ingram v Ingram</em>,[12] Jordan CJ said:<br />"The meaning of the word ‘fail’ depends upon the context in which it is found. In some contexts it may mean simply the omission to do the thing in question, irrespectively of any reason which may have existed for his not doing it: [authorities quoted]. In other cases it may mean an omission to do the thing by reason of some carelessness or delinquency on his part, but not omission caused by impossibility for which the person in question is not responsible: ... In other cases, it may mean omission to do the thing, but so that omission caused by impossibility arising from some causes is included and from others is excluded."<br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;It is trite to observe that what the words "has failed" mean must be determined giving effect to the purpose of the Act and, after considering the words in context, taking into account the Act as a whole. The object of statutory construction is to determine what Parliament intended. The primary source of the intention is the words used, construed in their normal and natural meaning, in context and after considering the statute as a whole. Statute requires a court to promote the purpose or object underlying the Act in preference to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object. See s35(a) <em>Interpretation of Legislation Act </em>1984. In <em>Project Blue Sky Inc v ABA</em>[13] four members of the High Court said:[14]<br />"However, the duty of a court is to give the words of the statutory provision the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. Ordinarily, that meaning (the legal meaning) will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the provision. But not always. The context of the words, the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction, the purpose of the statute or the canons of construction may require the words of the legislative provision to be read in a way that does not correspond with the literal or grammatical meaning."<br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;It is observed that the consequences of a literal or grammatical construction are matters that are relevant to the Court’s task. One consequence of a literal application of the words would be that if the person bailed was dead, the Court would nevertheless be bound to make the declaration and orders under s6(1) even though there was no fault on the part of either the accused person or the surety. It is arguable that that would be an absurd result and one not intended by Parliament. On the other hand, the absurd consequences could be overcome by application being made under s6(4), and accordingly the opportunity to have a second hearing would overcome any absurd result.<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Marcusson v Southern Shipping Co</em>,[15] the High Court was concerned with a provision in the Excise Act of the Commonwealth which provided that if a person failed to keep safely goods which have been entrusted to him by Customs, the person was obliged to pay to the Commonwealth an amount equal to the amount of unpaid excise duty. In that case, excisable goods on which excise had not been paid were delivered to a carrier at a wharf and, pending being loaded aboard a ship, were placed in a store which was then locked and the keys were lodged in the Customs office. Subsequently, the goods were stolen from the store and it was accepted by Customs that they were not stolen by the body responsible for their safe keeping. The question arose whether in the circumstances the body concerned had failed to keep the goods safely. In the circumstances it was held that the carrier was liable. McTiernan J[16] discussed the word "fails". His Honour said:<br />"’Fails’ is a word with various meanings. I think that in s60 its appropriate meaning is that the person concerned is to be liable if he comes short of keeping the goods safely, that is preserving them from loss or damage. <u>The word ‘fails’, in my opinion, is not strong enough to impose upon the person concerned so onerous a duty as that of avoiding the unavoidable. </u>The plaintiff’s contention would mean that it does. <em>Lex non cogit ad impossibilia</em>. [The law does not compel the impossible.] Paragraph (a) should be read subject only to that presumption." <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>37.&nbsp;</strong>As a general rule the law is concerned with proof of fault before an adverse order is made. Of course there are exceptions. But the law does not compel the impossible. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, there are countervailing arguments of substance concerning the meaning and application of the words "has failed to observe a condition of bail". The question is, does the Crown have to prove that the breach was deliberate? In the circumstances it is unnecessary for me to answer the question because in any event, the Crown has placed evidence before the Court which has not been contested by other evidence, and which proves on the balance of probabilities that the absence of the prisoner on 20 March 2006 was the result of a deliberate act. Further, the Court raised with counsel the issue, and counsel had not had the opportunity of fully considering and researching the issue. In the circumstances I will briefly note some of the arguments:<br />• A literal construction not involving proof of fault may lead to an absurd result; <br />• However any absurd result may be overcome by a further application under s6(4); <br />• What the words mean must depend upon the context and the purpose of the statutory provision. The meaning will vary according to the context; <br />• The law is usually concerned with fault and does not compel the impossible; <br />• The difficulties involved in the Crown adducing evidence of fault militates against an interpretation based on fault. On the other hand, the Crown would only be expected to adduce such evidence as it could in all the circumstances and the mere absence of suspicious circumstances may be sufficient to prove fault on the part of the accused; <br />• A literal application without proof of fault would mean that a surety would be the subject of a penalty even though it was impossible for the surety to comply with his or her obligations; <br />• The purpose of the undertaking given by a surety and the consequences which flow from that undertaking are to ensure that the surety takes steps to ensure that the accused attend at trial. The undertaking of the surety and the consequences of a failure are intended to act as a deterrent to the accused absconding. These purposes are not defeated if the failure of the accused to attend results from something beyond the control of the accused, such as death or kidnapping.<br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, if proof of fault was necessary, the quantum of proof will depend upon the circumstances of each case. In most cases the mere failure to attend may be sufficient. The surrounding circumstances may very quickly establish that it was a deliberate act. <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;The principal obligation of a surety is to ensure that the accused person bailed honours his obligation to appear at the trial. The failure to do so exposes the surety to a financial penalty, which in certain circumstances may be substantial, and in default of payment, a period of imprisonment, which may be up to two years. By giving an undertaking, the surety obliges himself or herself to honour it. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;The informant, Federal Agent Ragg, gave evidence relevant to the question of whether the prisoner had failed to observe a condition of bail by absconding. In addition to the evidence called, there are a number of factual matters which have been established relevant to the exercise. As the presiding judge at trial, I was able to observe the witnesses and appraise the evidence and, in my opinion, I am entitled to take into account that experience in considering whether the Crown has proven on the balance of probabilities the failure to observe a condition of bail. Of course I was obliged to reveal my views to the parties and I did so. I find that the following facts have been established:<br />• The prisoner failed to attend his trial on 20 March 2006, and there is no evidence that he is dead, has suffered an injury precluding him from attending at Court or is being detained against his will;<br />• The prisoner failed to attend at a point in the trial when all evidence had been adduced, the Crown prosecutor had addressed the jury for a day and a half, and it was evident that the Crown case was indeed compelling. This would have been obvious to the prisoner’s counsel and, in the normal course of events, would have been conveyed to the accused;<br />• The submissions of no case and a directed acquittal failed and when coupled with the compelling Crown case, the prisoner’s chances of acquittal were extremely slim.<br />• Conclusionary evidence given by Mr Ragg prior to the charge was to the effect that, based upon information he had, it was his belief that the accused had absconded. It was submitted by the Crown that the failure of defence counsel to cross-examine Mr Ragg at the time should be taken into account, but in my view it should not. The interests of the surety are different to those of the accused and the failure of the accused’s counsel to cross-examine could not in any way be used against the surety;<br />• The surety has not placed any evidence before the Court on this application. Through her counsel, she has informed the Court that she will make an application pursuant to s6(4) of the Act in the event of an order being made under s6(1), and that she does not wish at this stage to place any evidence before the Court;<br />• Federal police have interviewed the prisoner’s family members, including the surety and known associates, and their enquiries revealed that the said persons had no idea where the prisoner was or why he failed to attend. No-one was able to assist the police in locating the prisoner and no-one has reported to the police a concern for eal pull of bail" by Lord Widgery CJ in <em>R v South Hamptom Justices, ex parte Corker</em>,[22] where his Lordship said:<br />"The real pull of bail, the real effective force that it exerts, is that it may cause the offender to attend his trial rather than subject his nearest and dearest who have gone surety for him to undue pain and discomfort."<br />(Quoted in <em>R v Uxbridge Justices ex parte Heward-Mills</em>.[23]) <br /><strong>57.</strong>&nbsp;The amount of $1 million is an extremely large amount and was fixed no doubt to minimise the risk that the prisoner might abscond. The period of the imprisonment in default of payment or part thereof is up to two years. There are no criteria specified in the section to guide a court in determining the period. As this is the first application in a two application procedure, the efforts made by the surety to ensure the appearance of the accused will not normally be placed before the Court on this application and any question of the blameworthiness of the surety is unlikely to be the subject of any evidence or submission. Mr Lasry made it clear that his client would not give any evidence in this application and that in the event of an order being made, his client would cause to be issued an application under s6(4). Given that there is no evidence placed before the Court on this application of the efforts made by the surety to ensure the accused’s compliance with his undertaking, in my opinion, the period of imprisonment is to be determined by the amount of the sum to be estreated. As a general rule, the greater the sum, the longer the period of imprisonment. The period of imprisonment in default of payment must be commensurate with the amount of the undertaking. <br /><strong>58.</strong>&nbsp;The amount fixed by the judicial officers in the past on all occasions has been $1 million. This by any standard is an extremely large sum and represents as high a sum as any required in this State. The amount was fixed to deter the accused from absconding and to encourage the surety to diligently take steps to ensure that the accused complied with his undertaking. It cannot be overstated that if a surety has any doubts or concerns about the accused’s compliance with his undertaking, the surety is entitled and indeed obliged to inform the authorities and, if thought appropriate, to be relieved of the obligations as a surety.<br /><strong>59.</strong>&nbsp;The period of two years’ imprisonment has been the maximum since 1977 and, in my view, is an inadequate period when the undertaking to pay a sum is fixed as high as $1 million. The Court invites Parliament to consider increasing the period, bearing in mind that the purpose of the default provision is to encourage both the accused and the surety to comply with their undertakings. In <em>Re Condon</em>, supra, Crockett J in 1972 ordered the payment of the recognizance of a surety, being $5,000, and in default of distress ordered imprisonment for 12 months. Making allowances for the change in value of money, this translates today to 12 months’ imprisonment for default of a payment substantially less than $200,000. In my opinion, the appropriate period of imprisonment for default of distress in each application is two years’ imprisonment. As the surety has been treated as a joint surety for both proceedings, the total period for imprisonment in respect of both applications is two years in the event of default. <br /><strong>60.</strong>&nbsp;Subject to any submissions by counsel, I propose to make the following declaration and orders in each application:<br />A. The Court declares that the bail be forfeited. <br />B. The Court orders that –<br />(1) The Surety Renate Lisa Mokbel pay the amount of $1,000,000 to the proper officer of the Court at Melbourne within 31 days after the date of this order; and&nbsp;<br />(2) In default of payment of the amount in accordance with the order the amount be obtained by seizing and selling the property of the said Surety; and <br />(3) In default of seizure and sale of property, in whole or in part, the Surety be imprisoned for a period of two years; and&nbsp;<br />(4) This order will operate and apply concurrently with the order made this day in the Commonwealth/State of Victoria application pursuant to s6(1) of the <em>Crown Proceedings Act </em>1958 so that the surety Mrs Renate Lisa Mokbel is obliged to pay in total $1,000,000 and in default of distress serve a total of two years’ imprisonment, in respect of both proceedings.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] See <em>Mokbel v DPP (No. 3)</em> [2002] VSC 393. <br />[2] [1971] VR 717. <br />[3] [1973] 1 VR 427. <br />[4] (2005) 155 A Crim R 76. <br />[5] [1920] VLR 182. <br />[6] [1973] VR 427. <br />[7] At p433. <br />[8] [1925] 1 KB 603. <br />[9] At p606. <br />[10] [1984] QB 381. <br />[11] See the undertaking of bail signed by the prisoner on 29 November 2005. <br />[12] (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 407 at p410. <br />[13] (1998) 194 CLR 355. <br />[14] At p384. <br />[15] [1962] ALR 758. <br />[16] At p763. <br />[17] (1843) 4 QB 468; 114 ER 975. <br />[18] At p977 of the ER. <br />[19] [2006] 1 WLR 857 at 867. <br />[20] [1910] 1 KB 369 at 373. <br />[21] See <em>The King v Porter</em>, <em>supra</em>. <br />[22] (1976) 120 SJ 214. <br />[23] [1983] 1 WLR 56 at 59.</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES: </strong>For the Crown: Mr D Parsons SC.

On the way out of work one day he was asked to come into an interview room where he was questioned by three managers. They suspected him of theft of a screwdriver set. He had no lawyer and no union representative with him. He denied the allegations. The managers searched his bag and found the screwdriver set. He said he knew nothing about it. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The managers told Mr Azzopardi the matter would be dropped if he resigned. He refused and the police were called. He was charged with theft. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;At all times Mr Azzopardi protested his innocence. He said the company had set him up because they were trying to get rid of him – he was on light duties due to a workplace injury and was not very productive. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The charge came before the Magistrates’ Court at Dandenong in 2005. After hearing the evidence of the managers and a summary of the evidence of the police informant, the Magistrate expressed concern about the way the managers had questioned Mr Azzopardi and searched his bag. His Honour found they had not cautioned Mr Azzopardi about his rights before interviewing him. He described the bag search as "illegal". He exercised his discretion to exclude the evidence of the managers (and the police informant) from the case. There was no other evidence, which meant the prosecution had to fail. The Magistrate made an order dismissing the charge. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;The Director of Public Prosecutions now appeals to this Court upon the ground that the Magistrate committed an error of law in excluding the evidence.[1] <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the DPP contends the Magistrate proceeded upon the incorrect footing that the managers were acting as investigating officials under the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958. Such officials are obliged to caution suspects before commencing to interview them.[2] In fact, so counsel contends, the managers were not investigating officials. They were acting as civilians. Therefore they were not obliged to caution Mr Azzopardi before questioning him.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Azzopardi accepts the managers were not investigating officials. Under the <em>Crimes Act</em>, an investigating official is a police officer or someone exercising police-like statutory powers.[3] The managers did not fall into this definition. However, submits counsel, the Magistrate did not exclude their evidence (and that of the informant) on this basis. His Honour excluded the evidence in the exercise of his general discretion because it would have been unfair to allow the prosecution to use it against Mr Azzopardi. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;It is quite clear that the managers were not investigating officials under the <em>Crimes Act</em>. The sole question in this appeal is whether the Magistrate proceeded upon the incorrect footing that they were. The answer to this question will be provided by a consideration of his Honour’s reasons. Along the way it will be necessary to consider whether it was open to his Honour to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his general unfairness discretion.<br /><strong>DID THE MAGISTRATE INCORRECTLY TREAT THE MANAGERS AS INVESTIGATING OFFICIALS?<br />9.</strong>&nbsp;The process of reasoning of the Magistrate is revealed by the transcript of the hearing. This transcript reveals that his Honour’s main concern was that the managers did not caution Mr Azzopardi about his rights. In other words, they did not say words to him like (to use the example given by the Magistrate): "We have reason to believe that you were involved in thefts. We want to ask you some questions in relation to those thefts. However, if you consider that the answer may incriminate you, you don’t have to answer those questions." <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the DPP submits that the Magistrate must have treated the managers as investigating officials under the Crimes Act because only officials of this kind are required by statute to administer a caution before questioning suspects. I cannot accept this submission for the following reasons. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;First, the Magistrate did not at any time say that the managers were investigating officials under the <em>Crimes Act</em>. If he had been of this view, he would have referred to the rules laid down in that Act for the conduct of interviews by investigating officials. For example, before questioning by such officials can commence, the person must be informed that "he or she does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be given in evidence."[4] The person must usually be informed that he or she has the right to communicate with a friend, relative and lawyer.[5] Interviews must usually be video-taped or video-recorded, depending upon the circumstances.[6] The Magistrate referred only to the failure of the managers to caution Mr Azzopardi and to the search of his bag. These concerns can relate to civilian investigators as well as to investigators who have police-like powers. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, the Magistrate used language that made clear he knew he was dealing with company managers using civilian powers, not investigating officers using statutory powers. He described the managers as "civilians" and said there were problems with such persons being involved in "police or investigative work." The clear inference here is that the problems in the case arose because the managers were not properly trained investigators like the police and similar investigating officials. In several parts of the transcript his Honour contrasted the approach of the managers with that of the police. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;Thirdly, the transcript reveals that the Magistrate considered the evidence of the managers and the informant to be "inadmissible" because Mr Azzopardi had not been cautioned and because his bag had been illegally searched. This was an exercise of his Honour’s general unfairness discretion to exclude evidence, for which, in the case before him, there was an amply sufficient basis. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The general unfairness discretion is available to a court "to exclude evidence where it considers that it would be unfair to the accused if it were admitted in the sense that this would or might render his or her trial unfair."[7] Evidence of a confession or admission, although voluntarily given or made, might be excluded if –<br />"in the light of all the circumstances the confession has been made in conditions which render it unjust to allow the accused’s own words to be given in evidence against him...The discretion is a discretion to exclude and is to be exercised in the interests of fairness and justice to the accused."[8]<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;The proper exercise of the general unfairness discretion requires a consideration of matters of fact and degree in the light of all of the circumstances of a given case.[9] The objects of bringing wrongdoers to justice and ensuring the fair trial of accused persons are weighed in the balance. <strong><br />16.</strong>&nbsp;It is not only the conduct of police or investigating officials under the <em>Crimes Act</em> that might give rise to the possible exclusion of evidence under the general unfairness discretion. The conduct of civilian investigators, such as store detectives, loss controllers and security personnel, might also do so. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;The instant case is an example of how this might happen. The evidence before the Magistrate revealed that, apart from the interview with the managers and the discovery of the screwdriver set in Mr Azzopardi’s bag, the case against him was wholly circumstantial. The evidence showed that the managers, who were his bosses, asked Mr Azzopardi, a cleaner, to come into a room where he was outnumbered three to one. They told him why he was being interviewed, but not that he did not have to say or do anything and, if he did, it could be given in evidence. He was asked to open his bag and he said he would not, which was his right. According to the evidence of the managers, this issue "went back and forth" until Mr Azzopardi said the managers could open it. They did so and found the screwdriver set. The police arrived later, but by then the bag had been opened. Mr Azzopardi told the police he was innocent. (As it happened, the evidence of the police did not add anything material to the prosecution case.) <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;It was on this evidence that the Magistrate exercised his general unfairness discretion to exclude the prosecution evidence, the important part of which was the evidence of the managers. This was not a case where it was only the failure to caution that led his Honour to exclude the managers’ evidence.[10] A fair reading of his reasons reveals that he was concerned about a number of problems – the failure to caution, the circumstances in which the bag was searched and the general conduct of the interview. It was open to his Honour to exercise his general unfairness discretion in these circumstances. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;The unsatisfactory situation confronting Mr Azzopardi was graphically illustrated by the reaction of the managers when he told them he was recording the interview on his mobile telephone. They instructed him he "wasn’t allowed to do that" and he deleted the recording. The managers expressly denied him the right to make what the police are usually obliged to provide, namely a recording of the interview.[11] <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;As the Magistrate said, the managers could have taken other action that may well have led to a different result. They could have called the police and asked Mr Azzopardi to wait until they arrived. If he refused, they could have effected a citizen’s arrest[12] and detained him until the police arrived. This is a prudent procedure commonly followed by civilian investigators such as store detectives, loss controllers and security officers. In all likelihood, the police would then have conducted a professional investigation and interview during which Mr Azzopardi’s rights would have been respected and the rules laid down in the <em>Crimes Act </em>would have been observed. The police would have discovered the screwdriver set in Mr Azzopardi’s bag as they would have had the power to search it with or without his consent. There could have been no valid objection to the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police through this process, although the fate of the prosecution might still have been doubtful because, as one of the managers candidly admitted in evidence, there was a possibility that someone other than Mr Azzopardi put the screwdriver set in his bag. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;It cannot be said that civilian investigators have no right to ask question of suspects and the Magistrate did not so decide. "The power of inquiry, of asking questions, is a power which every individual citizen possesses...[although he] cannot compel an answer..."[13] But if civilian investigators do ask questions of suspects, the conduct of the interview may be put in issue in any trial, as occurred in the present case. It cannot be said that civilian investigators are legally obliged to caution suspects of whom they intend to ask questions and the Magistrate did not so decide. But before asking any questions, it would be prudent for investigators to inform suspects that they do not have to say or do anything and that anything said or done may be given in evidence. If this is not done, this may be used as a basis to have evidence excluded in the exercise of the court’s general unfairness discretion. Such a failure, on its own, may not be a sufficient basis upon which to exclude the evidence.[14] But taken together with other circumstances, as in the present case, such a failure may well result in evidence being excluded. A debate about the admissibility of evidence obtained in these circumstances can be avoided if civilian investigators call the police and get them to conduct the interview and investigation.<br /><strong>CONCLUSION</strong><br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Azzopardi was charged with theft from his employer. The main evidence against him was obtained during an interview conducted by three of his managers. He had no lawyer or union representative present and he was not informed of his legal rights. The Magistrate dismissed the charge after deciding that the evidence of the managers (and the informant) was inadmissible. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;The DPP has appealed. The ground is that the Magistrate made an error of law by incorrectly treating the managers as investigating officials under the <em>Crimes Act </em>(who are obliged to inform suspects of their legal rights) rather than civilian investigators (who are not so obliged). <strong><br />24.</strong>&nbsp;The appeal will be dismissed because the Magistrate, in excluding the evidence, did not treat the managers as investigating officials who failed to inform Mr Azzopardi of his legal rights as required by the Crimes Act. His Honour treated the managers as civilian investigators and excluded the evidence in the exercise of his general unfairness discretion. <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;The circumstances of this case show it can be hazardous for civilian investigators to interview criminal suspects, all the more so if they conduct interviews without informing them of their legal rights. The way they conduct interviews may result in evidence being excluded in the exercise of a court’s general unfairness discretion. The most prudent course is for civilian investigators to call the police.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] Section 92(1) of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 allows a party to a criminal proceeding to appeal to the Supreme Court of Victoria on a question of law from a final order of a magistrate. <br />[2] Section 464A(3) provides: "Before any questioning (other than a request for the person’s name and address) or investigation ... an investigating official must inform the person in custody that he or she does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be given in evidence." <br />[3] Section 464 defines an "investigation official" to mean "a member of the police force or a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a member or person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions or duties include functions or duties in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences..." <br />[4] Section 464A(3) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. <br />[5] Section 464C(1) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. <br />[6] Section 464H(1) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. <br />[7] <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Moore </em>(2004) 39 MVR 323 at 342 per Chernov JA; see also at 353-354 per Eames JA and <em>Rozenes v Beljajev </em>[1995] 1 VR 533 at 549 per Brooking, McDonald and Hansen JJ. <br />[8] <em>R v Oates </em>[1979] Tas R 203 at 205 per Oates J. <br />[9] <em>R v Lee </em>(1950) 82 CLR 133 at 154 per Latham CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ. <br />[10] Compare <em>Bessell v Krysckiewicz </em>(1997) TASSC, 29 August 1997, Cox CJ. <br />[11] See s 464H of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. <br />[12] See s 458(1) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. <br />[13] <em>Glough v Leahy </em>(1905) 2 CLR 139 at 156-157 per Griffith CJ. <br />[14] As in <em>Bessell </em>(1997) TASSC, 29 August 1997.</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES: </strong>For the Plaintiff DPP: Mr C Beale, counsel.

Did the Learned Magistrate err in law in finding that, notwithstanding the undisputed evidence that the Respondent exhaled into the breath analysing instrument and that the resulting Certificate of Analysis recorded a result of "0.101 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath", he could not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the "breath" referred to in the Certificate of Analysis was "exhaled air" as that term is used in the definition of "prescribed concentration of alcohol" in s3 of the <em>Road Safety Act</em>? <br />2. Did the Learned Magistrate err in law in dismissing the charges (brought pursuant to s49(1)(b) and s49(1)(f) <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986) in acting against the weight of the evidence; that is, the undisputed evidence that the Respondent drove a vehicle, that within 3 hours of driving he furnished a sample of breath in accordance with s55, that the result of the analysis as recorded or shown by the breath analysing instrument indicated that more than the PCA was present in the Respondent’s breath? <br />Grounds of Appeal <br />1. The Learned Magistrate erred in law in finding that, notwithstanding the undisputed evidence that the Respondent exhaled into the breath analysing instrument and that the resulting Certificate of Analysis recorded a result of "0.101 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath", he could not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the "breath" referred to in the Certificate of Analysis was "exhaled air" as that term is used in the definition of "prescribed concentration of alcohol" in s3 of the <em>Road Safety Act</em>. <br />2. The Learned Magistrate erred in law in dismissing the charges (brought pursuant to s49(1)(b) and s49(1)(f) <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986) in acting against the weight of the evidence; that is, the undisputed evidence that the Respondent drove a vehicle, that within 3 hours of driving he furnished a sample of breath in accordance with s55, that the result of the analysis as recorded or shown by the breath analysing instrument indicated that more than the PCA was present in the Respondent’s breath."<br /><strong>The issue <br />3.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Bleakley had provided a sample of breath by blowing into a breathalyser. This was done in accordance with the Road Safety Act provisions. The analysis as recorded in the certificate of analysis indicated that more than .05 grams of alcohol "in 210 litres of breath" was present in that sample. An issue was raised at the original hearing as to whether the evidence as to the reading proved beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant had exceeded the prescribed concentration of alcohol. The argument was that that concept was defined in s2 to include "a concentration of alcohol present in the breath of 0.05 grams per 210 litres of exhaled air". It was argued that evidence of alcohol level in breath was not the same thing as the level of alcohol in exhaled air. The learned Magistrate described the problem in these terms:<br />"There is a real difficulty, in my view, in relying upon the words used upon this certificate and then concluding or inferring that those words mean what is described in the definition section. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the words ‘result: 0.101 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath’, together with the evidence that Mr Bleakley blew into the machine, demonstrate that a concentration of alcohol present in the breath of that person is 0.05 grams per 210 litres or more of exhaled air was the result."<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;It was common ground that critical to the issue, and the learned Magistrates decision, was the view that there was a distinction to be drawn in the Act between the concept of "breath" and the concept of "exhaled air". <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;It was also common ground that that issue was considered late last year, after the hearing before the learned Magistrate in this case, by Hargrave J in <em>Sirajuddin v Ziino</em>.[1] In that case the same argument was run but on that occasion the defendant was unsuccessful. His Honour posed the question as follows:<br />"Did Parliament intend there to be any difference between the concentration of alcohol in a person’s breath and the concentration of alcohol in a person’s exhaled air?"<br />His Honour expressed the view that to attribute such an intention to Parliament, when resort is had to the act as a whole, is absurd. After referring in some detail to the relevant provisions in the legislation his Honour concluded:<br />"35. In my view, it is clear the Parliament intended that the breath of a person is to be sampled by the person exhaling sufficient air to enable the breath analysing instrument to measure the concentration of alcohol in the breath of that person. Accordingly, I conclude that Parliament did not, by referring to ‘exhaled air’ in the definition of prescribed concentration of alcohol, intend to draw any distinction between breath and exhaled air. The whole purpose of the provisions under consideration is to provide, in the words of s47(c) of the Act a simple and effective means of establishing that there is present in the . . . breath of a driver more than the legal limit of alcohol." <br />36. In my view, the reference to ‘exhaled air’ means nothing more, less or different than a person’s breath which is exhaled into a breath analysing instrument within the meaning of the Act."<br />In my view, his Honour’s analysis is the correct analysis. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Faced with the decision, counsel for the respondent sought first to distinguish the decision and, in the alternative, attempted to argue that it was wrong. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Three points of distinction were raised. The first concerned the different nature of the appeals and the specific issues raised. While those distinctions may be made, they do not appear to me to be relevant distinctions which have any impact on the critical question of construction common to both proceedings and decided in Sirajuddin. The second point of distinction raised was that in Sirajuddin, no notice had been served under s58 (2) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>so that the certificate was conclusive proof whereas in the present case, such a notice was given. Again, that distinction does not appear to me to have any bearing upon the issue which is a question of the construction of the provisions. Finally, it was put that counsel for the motorist in <em>Sirajuddin </em>had submitted that it wasn’t possible for a person to continuously exhale 210 litres of breath into a breath analysing instrument but in the present case no such concession had been made. Again this appears to be another distinction which does not in fact enable the construction determined in Sirajuddin to be distinguished. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;In arguing that the construction of Hargrave J should not be followed, counsel submitted that greater precision was needed for the definition of the terms than was adopted by Hargave J. It was argued that "near enough" is not good enough in relation to the definitions. Reference was made to the decision of <em>Impagnatiello v Campbell</em>[2] where an incomplete description of the breath analysing instrument was fatal to the Crown case and to other examples. In my view, the interpretation adopted by Hargrave J provides the necessary precision to enable the legislation to function appropriately. Reference was also made to the variety of expressions that one finds in dictionaries to explain the meaning of "exhaled" and the meaning of "per" and "in" as well as the word "breath". Accepting for present purposes that there are different shades of meaning for different contexts, I have no hesitation in coming to the same conclusion as Hargrave J as to the appropriate meaning to be attached to those expressions in the Act. In particular, his Honour noted that the word "in" has many meanings but that one of them is "as a proportionate part of". He said that that is how the word "in" should be read in the certificate and that it was absurd to give it any other meaning because, as was submitted on behalf of the appellant, it is obviously impossible for a person to continuously exhale 210 litres of breath into a breath analysing instrument. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate did not have the benefit of the analysis of Hargrave J. I agree with that analysis and accordingly have come to the conclusion that error of law has been shown and the appeal should be allowed. I will hear further submissions as to the consequential orders that should be made.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p>[1] [2005] VSC 418. <br />[2] (2003) 6 VR 416.</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the appellant DPP: Mr CW Beale, counsel.

That is how it was described by trial counsel; that is how it was seen by the judge; and that is how it was characterised by counsel in argument in this Court. In the course of argument in the present appeal, counsel were invited to provide further written submissions on the nature of the application that was made to Judge&nbsp;Christie at the conclusion of the prosecution case. It appears from those written submissions that there is no disagreement on this point.<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Doney v The Queen</em>[5], this Court held that, at a criminal trial before a judge and jury, if at the end of a prosecution case there is evidence that is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty then the trial judge may not direct a verdict of not guilty, but must leave the matter to the jury for its decision. This Court affirmed the New South Wales decision in <em>R v R</em>[6], the South Australian decision in <em>R v Prasad</em>[7], and the Victorian decision in <em>Attorney-Generals Reference (No 1 of 1983)</em>[8]. No challenge was made to the correctness of <em>Doney</em>. The question whether there is evidence capable of supporting a verdict at a civil or criminal trial by jury is a question of law. As was explained in <em>Doney</em>[9], this is a different question from whether a jury ought to be warned about the probative value of evidence. It is different from the question whether a trial judge might properly inform a jury, at any time after the close of the prosecution case, of its power to acquit[10]. And it is different from the question which confronts an appellate court when it has to decide whether a conviction is unreasonable. There is no advantage to be gained by blurring these differences. Keeping them in mind helps to avoid confusion. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor</em>[11], an appeal to the Privy Council from Singapore, Lord Diplock gave the reasons of the Judicial Committee. Trial by jury had been abolished in Singapore. His Lordship said[12]: <br />"It is well established that in a jury trial at the conclusion of the prosecutions case it is the judges function to decide for himself whether evidence has been adduced which, <u>if it were to be accepted by the jury as accurate</u>, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence: for what are the essential elements in any criminal offence is a question of law ... <br />In their Lordships view the same principle applies to criminal trials where the combined roles of decider of law and decider of fact are vested in a single judge (or in two judges trying capital cases). At the conclusion of the prosecutions case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence." (Emphasis in original) <br />His Lordships references to the accuracy of evidence over-simplifies the nature of issues of fact that may arise at a trial, civil or criminal. Questions concerning the weight of evidence, or the inferences to be drawn from it, or, in circumstantial cases, the reasonably available hypotheses, may also arise. The present case provides an example. There was no room for argument about what was said at the meeting of 22&nbsp;June 2001. There was room for argument about the inferences to be drawn from what was said. But in deciding, as a matter of law, whether there was evidence which could establish the prosecution case, the trial judge was concerned with inferences that were available. He was not, at that stage, concerned to decide what inferences he would ultimately draw. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;In the same case, Lord Diplock said[13]: <br />"Whoever has the function of deciding facts on the trial of a criminal offence should keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of recollection of any individual witness, whether called for the prosecution or the defence, until after all the evidence ... has been heard and it is possible to assess to what extent (if any) that witnesss evidence has been confirmed, explained or contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses." <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;If a submission of no case to answer is understood as raising a question of law about whether there is evidence capable of supporting a finding of guilt, that warning presents no problem. It would be otherwise if a judge were invited to embark upon a factual evaluation of the evidence called up to a particular stage of the trial, and give a ruling based on the weight of that evidence. No such problem arose in the present case. Counsel for the first appellant, who had the carriage of the argument, made both written and oral submissions in support of his argument that there was no case to answer. Those submissions were consistent with the principles stated above. Counsel said: "I accept for the purposes of my submission that I must take the Crown case at its highest". The trial judge, in giving reasons for his later refusal to disqualify himself because of what had happened in connection with the "no case" submission, said that he had formed "a very, very firm view" that the submission must fail "as a matter of law". <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;As a matter of law, there was a case to answer. On the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to interpret the demands made by the appellants as demands for ongoing protection payments, extending beyond the sum of $8,000. It was also open to the trial judge to conclude, in the light of the menacing words and conduct of the appellants, that, far from pursuing a genuinely held belief in their right to be paid $8,000, they were pursuing a campaign of extortion. When counsel for the first appellant acknowledged, as he was bound to do, that the judge had to take the prosecution case at its highest, implicit in that was an acknowledgment that the prosecution evidence was being examined, for its sufficiency of proof, without any testimony from the appellants in explanation of their conduct; in a context where the central issue concerned the existence and honesty of their belief in the legitimacy of their claims. At the time of the trial judges ruling, they had not said they held such a belief; and there was ample evidence to sustain a conclusion that they did not hold such a belief. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;The terms of the written opening handed up by counsel for the first appellant suggest that, from the beginning, the trial judge would have been anticipating a no case to answer submission. He would have been thinking about the argument foreshadowed in the opening. If he had surmised that it would be very difficult to sustain, he would have been correct. Nevertheless, his peremptory announcement, as soon as the application was mentioned, that he would dismiss it, was a departure from the standards of fairness and detachment required of a trial judge. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;Judges do not have to devote unlimited time to listening to unmeritorious arguments. Sometimes, a brief hearing will suffice. Judges may anticipate events at trial, and foresee lines of argument that may be developed. Here, the appellants made it clear from the outset that they hoped to be able to secure acquittal without giving evidence themselves. Perhaps the judge felt indignant about the conduct disclosed by the evidence, or about the tactics adopted by the appellants. Indignation is a natural reaction to some facts that are disclosed, or some events that occur, at a criminal trial or, for that matter, on an appeal. It should never be permitted to compromise the appearance of impartiality that is required of judges. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;It appears from the remarks on sentence that the first appellant has a serious criminal record for offences including armed robbery. It further appears from comments made by the judge that he found the demeanour of the first appellant during the trial to be menacing. The judge regarded this as a strong case of extortion. He formed the view, with good reason, that the no case to answer submission was likely to be implausible. Yet he should not have decided to reject it without giving counsel an opportunity to put the argument. In the circumstances, that would not have required much time. The way in which the judge dealt with the no case argument, and later with the question of bail, gave rise to an appearance of lack of impartiality.

There is a rule of evidence that communications between parties which are genuinely aimed at settlement of a dispute between them cannot be put in evidence without the consent of both parties in the event that the dispute is not settled. This rule is often called "without prejudice privilege". In order for the privilege to operate, it is essential that there must be some person in dispute or negotiation with another person, and the statement which it is sought to exclude from evidence must have some bearing on negotiations for a settlement of that dispute. The mere use of the words "without prejudice" in the communication does not operate to attract the rule of privilege. The court is required to consider the statement in its context and decide for itself whether the privilege applies. Thus a letter marked "without prejudice" which is not in fact a genuine attempt to settle a dispute will not be privileged from production in evidence, and a letter which is so aimed will be privileged even if it is not marked "without prejudice." <br />2. Where a letter marked "without prejudice" was written when a proceeding between the parties had concluded, the letter was not, when viewed in its proper context, privileged from production in later proceedings concerning an order to pay the debt by way of instalments. There was no dispute to settle in those events. The "without prejudice" letter was simply a request for time to pay an existing obligation which was the subject of a court order. Such a request was not one which would properly be characterised as a genuine attempt to settle a dispute. Accordingly the magistrate was right to have regard to the without prejudice letter, and no error of law was disclosed in that regard.<br /><br />HARGRAVE J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;On 5 September 2005 the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ("VCAT") heard and determined a proceeding by the defendants in this proceeding against the plaintiffs in this proceeding. VCAT ordered that the plaintiffs pay the sum of $8,702 to the defendants within seven days. The plaintiffs did not do so. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;It appears that a certified copy of the VCAT order was filed in the Magistrates Court of Victoria under s121 of the <em>Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act </em>1998 (Vic). By sub-s121(3) of that Act, the VCAT order upon filing was taken to be a judgment of the Magistrates Court of Victoria. The first plaintiff, Mr Slaveski, who is the sole director and secretary of the second plaintiff and whom I gave leave to appear to represent the second plaintiff, considered appealing against the VCAT order, but decided not to do so for reasons which are not relevant. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Instead he instructed solicitors then acting for the plaintiffs to offer to pay the judgment debt by instalments. As a result, by letter dated 28 September 2005 from the solicitors then acting for the plaintiffs to the solicitors then acting for the defendants the following offer was made: <br />"Given our clients current financial circumstances he proposes the following instalment payment, namely, an immediate payment of $2,000. Thereafter monthly instalments of $1,000 with a final payment of $1,702. We appreciate your advice of your clients instructions by return facsimile."<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The letter was headed, "Without Prejudice", and I will for convenience refer to it as "the without prejudice letter". The offer contained in the without prejudice letter was not accepted and was withdrawn for reasons which are not relevant. Next, on 17 October 2005 the plaintiffs applied to the Magistrates Court of Victoria at Broadmeadows under the <em>Judgment Debt Recovery Act </em>1984 (Vic) for an order that they be permitted to pay the judgment debt by instalments of $500 per month. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;On the basis of statements made in the written application as to the financial position and capacity of the plaintiffs, on 24 October 2005 the Magistrates Court at Broadmeadows ordered that the plaintiffs pay the judgment debt by monthly instalments of $500. On 12 November 2005 the plaintiffs paid the first instalment of $500 having previously paid $1,000 in part satisfaction of the debt. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;However, notwithstanding that the plaintiff made application to this Court for a stay of the instalment order as later varied on 5 December 2005, which application for a stay was dismissed, the plaintiffs have made no further payments in satisfaction of the judgment debt. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The defendants were dissatisfied with the instalment order made on 24 October 2005, and filed a notice of objection under s6(5) of the <em>Judgment Debt Recovery Act </em>1984 (Vic). The objection was fixed for hearing in the Magistrates Court at Dandenong on 5 December 2005. On 5 December 2005 the objection was heard by a magistrate. The magistrate allowed the objection, cancelled the original instalment order of $500 per month, and made an order that the judgment debt be paid in accordance with the offer contained in the without prejudice letter. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The formal order of the court is in the following terms: <br />"The judgment debt be paid: <br />(1) First payment of $2,000 by 9 December 2005. <br />(2) Monthly payments of $1,000 commencing on 1 January 2006. Final payment of $1,702."<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The affidavit evidence about what happened before the magistrate was scant. The tape of the proceedings has been lost or misplaced. However, the parties agreed to proceed before me on the basis that the magistrates decision was based upon the without prejudice letter, which was handed up to him at the hearing by the defendants. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;On 14 December 2005, Harper J gave the first plaintiff leave to commence this proceeding on behalf of the second plaintiff. The plaintiffs have been unrepresented throughout the proceeding, as have the defendants. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;The proceeding was commenced by originating motion filed on 14 December 2005. It is in the nature of an appeal to this Court on a question of law under s92 of the <em>Magistrates Court Act </em>1989 (Vic). The sole ground of appeal stated in the originating motion is that the without prejudice letter formed the basis of the decision of the magistrate. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Slaveski submitted that, as the without prejudice letter was so marked, the without prejudice letter ought not to have been produced in court, or relied upon by the magistrate. Mr Slaveski did not develop his submission further. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;There is a rule of evidence that communications between parties which are genuinely aimed at settlement of a dispute between them cannot be put in evidence without the consent of both parties in the event that the dispute is not settled.[1] This rule is often called "without prejudice privilege".<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In order for the privilege to operate, it is essential that there must be some person in dispute or negotiation with another person, and the statement which it is sought to exclude from evidence must have some bearing on negotiations for a settlement of that dispute.[2] <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;The mere use of the words "without prejudice" in the communication does not operate to attract the rule of privilege. The court is required to consider the statement in its context and decide for itself whether the privilege applies. Thus a letter marked "without prejudice" which is not in fact a genuine attempt to settle a dispute will not be privileged from production in evidence, and a letter which is so aimed will be privileged even if it is not marked "without prejudice."[3] <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, the without prejudice letter in this case was not, when viewed in its proper context, privileged from production in evidence before the magistrate. At the time the without prejudice letter was written there was in fact no dispute between the parties. This is because the VCAT proceeding had been decided and orders made. The plaintiffs had elected not to seek leave to appeal that result. The VCAT orders had been filed in the Magistrates Court. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;There was no dispute to settle in these events. The without prejudice letter was simply a request for time to pay an existing obligation which was the subject of a court order. Such a request is not one which is properly characterised as a genuine attempt to settle a dispute. Accordingly the magistrate was right to have regard to the without prejudice letter, and no error of law is disclosed in that regard. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;As a result the appeal must be dismissed. As none of the parties has been represented I will make no order as to costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] <em>Rush and Tompkins v Greater London Council </em>[1989] AC 1280 at 1287-8; <em>Field v Commissioner of Railways (NSW) </em>(1957) 99 CLR 285 at 291. <br />[2] <em>Re Daintrey; Ex parte Holt </em>[1893] 2 QB 116 at 119; <em>Gregory v Philip Morris Ltd </em>(1988) 80 ALR 455 at 475; <em>Field v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) </em>(1957) 99 CLR 285 at 291. <br />[3] <em>Re Daintrey; Ex parte Holt </em>[1893] 2 QB 116 at 119; <em>South Shropshire District Council v Amos </em>[1986] 1 WLR 1217; <em>Gregory v Philip Morris </em>(1988) 80 ALR 455 at 475; <em>Buckinghamshire County Council v Moran </em>[1990] Ch 623.</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES: </strong>For the plaintiffs Slaveski &amp; Sky Empire: Mr L Slaveski, in person.

The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge’s conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by some judges of the capacity or performance of their colleagues. At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to be reasonable; and the person being observed is ‘a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require the judge to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial’. Whilst the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge, the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice. The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation.<br />&nbsp;<em>Johnson v Johnson </em>(2000) 201 CLR 488, applied.&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp;In the present case the test was not whether the impartial observer may think that it was unfair that the judge refused to revoke the bail, and then refused an application to vary or rescind the order forfeiting bail and ordering the surety to pay a substantial sum of money and, in default, imprisonment. The test is that a judge should not sit to hear a case "if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question involved in it". The reasonable hypothetical observer seated in the back of the Court and having the necessary knowledge of all relevant matters, would not entertain a reasonable apprehension that the judge could not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the questions involved in the application.&nbsp;<br /><br />GILLARD J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;Before the Court is an application by Mrs Renate Lisa Mokbel ("Mrs Mokbel") pursuant to s6(4) of the <em>Crown Proceedings Act </em>1958 ("the Act"), seeking an order to vary or rescind orders made by the Court on 26 April 2006<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;On that day, the Court declared that bail granted to Antonios Sajih Mokbel ("the principal") be declared forfeited pursuant to s6(1) of the Act. The Court ordered that Mrs Mokbel, who was the surety, pay an amount of $1,000,000 to an officer of this Court within 31 days of the date of the order and, in default of payment, that the amount be obtained by seizing and selling her property and, further in default, that she serve a term of imprisonment of two years. The orders declaring the recognisance forfeited and, in default of payment, imprisonment, were in respect to two separate proceedings. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;By reason of s6(4) of the Act, a surety is given the right to apply to the Court that made the order to vary or rescind the order "on the ground it would be unjust to require him to pay the amount undertaken to be paid having regard to all the circumstances of the case." Mrs Mokbel has made application in respect to both proceedings, namely, the Commonwealth and State prosecutions against the principal. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The return date for the hearing is 20 June 2006. The Court fixed 31 May 2006 for a directions hearing, and counsel on behalf of Mrs Mokbel, Mr L. Lasry QC, applied to the Court that I should disqualify myself from hearing the application because of perceived bias. Mr Lasry disavowed any suggestion of actual bias. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;In order to understand the submission put on behalf of the applicant, it is necessary to set out some of the background history. The principal was arrested on 24 August 2001 and charged with the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of a prohibited import, namely, a traffickable quantity of cocaine, which arrived in Australia on 6 November 2000, contrary to paragraph 233B(1)(d) of the <em>Customs Act</em> 1901. On arrest, he was remanded in custody. He was granted bail by a magistrate on 7 September 2000 and on 1 October 2000, Cummins J in this Court allowed the appeal and the principal was remanded in custody. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;During 2002, the principal made a number of applications to this Court for bail and eventually, on 4 September 2002, Kellam J granted him bail subject to strict conditions. A surety of $1,000,000 was required. In addition to the Commonwealth charge, the principal was charged by State police, on 24 August 2001, with a number of serious drug charges relating to trafficking. The bail granted by Kellam J was in respect to both the Commonwealth and State charges. Mrs Mokbel was the surety in respect to both grants of bail. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;There was an inordinate delay between 4 September 2002 and the committals. The Commonwealth committal took place in November 2004. On 26 November 2004, a magistrate committed the principal for trial and bail was granted, again subject to strict conditions. There was a requirement of one surety in the sum of $1,000,000. Mrs Mokbel on that day signed the undertaking as surety. She is the wife of the principal’s brother, Milad. She swore an affidavit on that day as to her means, and a number of documents were supplied to the Registrar of the Court purporting to show that she had an interest in real estate at 11 Downs Street, Brunswick. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The committal in respect to the State charges occurred in 2005, and on 15 February 2005, the principal was committed for trial on three counts of trafficking in drugs. Again, the principal was released on bail with one surety of $1,000,000. Mrs Mokbel was the surety. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;During the course of 2005, I held a number of directions hearings in respect to both sets of charges and it was agreed that the Commonwealth matter would proceed first, and that the State matter would be heard after completion of the Commonwealth prosecution. I fixed the date of the trial for 26 October 2005. That date had to be vacated and I re-fixed the trial for 1 February 2006. On 29 November 2005, application was made to the Court to extend the existing bail. On that day, I extended bail in the Commonwealth proceeding until 1 February 2006, and the principal was bailed on his own undertaking with one surety in the sum of $1,000,000. The bail in the State charges was also extended on the same conditions. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;On 29 November 2005, the principal and the surety, Mrs Mokbel, attended before the Deputy Prothonotary of this Court and signed a document acknowledging receipt of the notice setting out the obligations of the principal concerning the conditions of his bail and the consequences of his failure to comply with the conditions. Mrs Mokbel signed an undertaking to pay to the Prothonotary the amount of bail specified in the event that the principal failed to observe a condition of bail. The undertaking was signed in relation to both the Commonwealth and State proceedings. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;The jury was empanelled in the Commonwealth prosecution on Monday, 13 February 2006, and the trial commenced. Bail was extended, subject to the same conditions, until further order. The defence case was closed on Thursday, 16 March 2006 and the prosecutor, Mr D. Parsons SC, commenced his address. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;On the following morning, the prosecutor informed the Court that he proposed to make an application to revoke the principal’s bail later that day. The prosecutor did not complete his address on that Friday. At 3.30pm, the jury was discharged for the weekend and the Crown made application to the Court that bail be revoked. It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the Crown case was a strong one, and that the stage had been reached in the trial when the bail should be revoked. Other than those matters, the Crown did not draw any particular matter to the attention of the Court, and disavowed any suggestion that there was any particular matter that the Court should consider. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;After hearing submissions, the Court stated that the bail would be revoked at the end of counsel’s addresses, which was anticipated to occur on the following Tuesday. On the morning of Monday, 20 March 2006, the Court was informed at 10.30am that the principal was missing and had not been seen since 5.00pm the previous evening, when he reported to the South Melbourne Police Station. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;On that day, a warrant to arrest the prisoner was issued by the Court. The trial continued and on 28 March 2006, the jury brought in a verdict of guilty. On 31 March 2006, the Court sentenced the principal to 12 years’ gaol and fixed a period of nine years before he was eligible for parole.[1] <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;The Crown in the right of the Commonwealth applied for a declaration and orders pursuant to s6(1) of the Act. On 29 March 2006, the Crown in the right of the State of Victoria filed a presentment in the Court in relation to the three State charges, and the Court ordered that a warrant be issued for the apprehension of the principal. In addition, the Crown sought an order against the surety pursuant to s6(1) of the Act. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The Commonwealth and State applications came on before me. On 26 April 2006, in respect to each application, the Court declared that the bail be forfeited and ordered that Mrs Mokbel pay the sum of $1,000,000 within 31 days; that in default of payment, the amount be obtained by seizing and selling her property; and that in default of seizure and sale, she be imprisoned for a period of two years. The orders further provided, to put beyond any doubt, that they had a joint operation in respect to both sets of charges and that, in total, Mrs Mokbel was liable in the sum of $1,000,000 and, in the ultimate default, was to be imprisoned for a period of two years.[2] On 15 May 2006, Mrs Mokbel applied, pursuant to s6(4), for an order to vary or rescind the orders made on 26 April 2006, and on 26 May 2006, I ordered a stay of those orders. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Lasry, on behalf of Mrs Mokbel, submits that I should disqualify myself from hearing the proceeding on the ground of perceived bias. Mr Parsons, on behalf of both Crowns, submitted that there was no basis for me disqualifying myself from hearing the applications. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The perceived bias was said to arise out of the events which occurred on Friday, 17 March 2006. This was the 28th day of the trial. The principal had strictly complied with all conditions of the various grants of bail going back some three and a half years. Mr Lasry submitted that evidence would be given that Mrs Mokbel was either present on that day, or was made aware of the Crown’s application to revoke bail, and the Court’s refusal to do so, and the intimation by the Court that bail would be revoked after counsel’s addresses. He informed the Court that a submission would be put that his client was to some extent comforted by the fact that the trial judge had not revoked bail that day. He then submitted that there may be some criticism made of the Court’s refusal to revoke bail that day and that this would reflect upon me, and that the reasonable person may conclude that the judge could not bring an impartial mind to the issues in the application. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;I observe that the fact that the Court did not revoke bail may be a relevant factor on the application. If so, then it is the fact of the refusal to revoke and the reason or reasons that were given for refusing the application that day, but not whether the reason or reasons were appropriate or correct, which may be relevant to the issues in the application. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Lasry submitted that the fair minded person may think that it was unfair that in the event of the application being dismissed, the judge who did not revoke the bail nevertheless was prepared to, in effect, punish the surety for failing to ensure that the principal attended Court on the Monday. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Lasry expressed the concern in this way: "Your Honour, if I can simply put the perception this way. At the end of these proceedings the question for the fair minded person sitting at the back of the Court is, if your Honour were to make an order resisting our client’s application to vary or set aside the order which you have already made, whether there is a significant risk that a fair minded observer might think ‘well in effect that’s a bit tough, she’s lost her house, million dollar house, because she is said to have failed in her duty as a surety’, and yet the judge who imposed that order three days earlier had declined the request by the Crown to revoke Mr Mokbel’s bail. How can that be fair and how can that be consistent? That is, in the bluntest of terms, the kind of perception that we say is relevant for your Honour to consider in this application."<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;It is noted that Mr Lasry is emphasising that the fair minded observer may come to the view that it would be unfair and inconsistent if the judge who declined to revoke bail nevertheless took the view that there was a strict obligation resting upon the surety, and the application failed. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;The principles that guide a court on an application for disqualification are well settled. Mr Lasry frankly conceded that there was no case which was similar to the present application. Indeed, most of the cases dealing with this issue in recent times have been concerned with a judicial officer making comments or observations during the course of a trial which demonstrated a predetermination, or with evidence of a pre-existing relationship with a party or someone connected with a party. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Before stating the principles concerning perceived bias, it is appropriate to say something about the desirability of the judge, who had dealt with the absence of the principal leading to the issue of a warrant of arrest and the order forfeiting the recognisance, dealing with any subsequent application. It has been the practice in this Court for many years for the judge who was seized with the original matter to deal with an application to vary or rescind the orders which flowed from the declaration of the forfeiture. I was allocated as the judge to hear the trials against the principal in mid-2005. I thereafter managed the interlocutory steps and presided at the Commonwealth trial. In the course of performing those duties, I obtained information about the principal and his involvement in the criminal activities.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, I am in an excellent position to fully understand the facts. In <em>Re Condon</em>,[3] Crockett J, a very experienced common lawyer, made an order for the payment of the amount of the recognisance by a surety. He made the order when the principal, being the accused person, failed to answer a charge of armed robbery. His Honour then heard the application to vary or rescind the order. His Honour referred to the desirability of the judge who made the order forfeiting the recognisance hearing the application to vary or rescind, and said: [4]<br />"The application came to me by reference from the judge sitting in chambers pursuant to a practice which, I understand, has now been followed for some time. The provision to which I have just referred allows the application to be made to a judge of the Court and the practice in the Supreme Court (but not the County Court where the matter is sent directly to the judge who first dealt with the matter) has been for the hearing of the application to be set down before the judge in chambers in the first instance to be followed by a reference, as I have indicated, to the judge who made the declaration that the recognisance in question be forfeited. The practice undoubtedly has much to commend it because the judge making such declaration does so with a knowledge of the background of the trial and the circumstances of the non-attendance of the bailed person that may be difficult for another judge to capture and yet such knowledge may be of great assistance in determining the matter. Indeed, on the hearing of this application it was plain from the submissions of both counsel that they had relied on much of which I was aware by reason of my association with the trial that was to have taken place and in respect of which the principal failed to appear."<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Although that is the desirable practice, from time to time the practice must give way to dictating circumstances. For example, in <em>Re Wilkinson</em>,[5] the practice was not followed.[6] However, in my view, the general practice should be followed and it is appropriate that I should entertain the application because of my detailed knowledge and understanding of all the circumstances. In making that observation, I am not saying that that is an answer to the present application. It plainly is not. I must consider and determine this application to disqualify on the merits, without taking into account the general practice. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;The High Court, on a number of occasions, has considered the principles of the apprehension of bias and the disqualification of a trial judge sitting alone, and their application to particular sets of facts. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;The most recent High Court case is <em>Antoun v The Queen</em>.[7] In that case, a judge sitting alone informed the accused’s counsel, before any submission was made, that a no case to answer submission would fail. He repeated that observation on two other occasions. This was a case of a judge pre-judging a matter and making that very clear to the parties before they had an opportunity of addressing him. This was a straightforward example of pre-judgment and the High Court held that the judge should have disqualified himself. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;The principles to apply in an application such as the present are not in doubt. In <em>Johnson v Johnson</em>,[8] five judges of the High Court said:[9]<br />"It is not contended that Anderson J was affected by actual bias. It has been established by a series of decisions of this Court that the test to be applied in Australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (which, in the present case, was said to take the form of pre-judgment), is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide."<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;Their Honours went on to observe:[10]<br />"The hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge’s conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by some judges of the capacity or performance of their colleagues. At the same time, two things need to be remembered: the observer is taken to be reasonable; and the person being observed is ‘a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation require [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial’."<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;It is important to determine what the fictional observer needs to know and understand. In relation to this point their Honours said:[11]<br />"Whilst the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge, the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice. The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation."<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;To this must be added what one expects the reasonable, fair minded observer to know. In <em>Webb v The Queen</em>,[12] Deane J said:[13]<br />"The fair minded observer is a hypothetical figure. While the question is not settled by any decision of the Court, it appears to me that the knowledge to be attributed to him or her is a broad knowledge of the material objective facts as ascertained by the appellate court, as distinct from a detailed knowledge of the law or knowledge of the character or ability of the members of the relevant court. The material objective facts include, of course, any published statement, whether prior, contemporaneous or subsequent, of the person concerned. If, in the particular case, the proper conclusion is that a fair-minded lay observer with a broad knowledge of those facts would not entertain a reasonable apprehension of bias, that is the end of the issue of disqualification by reason of an appearance of bias."<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour’s observations were referred to with approval by the High Court in <em>Johnson v Johnson</em>.[14<br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;One other matter must be stated and emphasised. That is that a judge should not too readily accept recusal because one of the parties to the matter requested it. In <em>Re JRL; Ex parte CJL</em>,[15] Mason J said:[16]<br />"It seems that the acceptance by this Court of the test of reasonable apprehension of bias in such cases as Watson and Livesey has led to an increase in the frequency of applications by litigants that judicial officers should disqualify themselves from sitting in particular cases on account of their participation in other proceedings involving one of the litigants or on account of conduct during the litigation. <u>It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party."</u> <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour’s observations have often been stated and applied in the cases. One of the reasons for his Honour’s observations is that in the administration of law in this country, as a general proposition, no party has any entitlement to choose which judicial officer will conduct the trial. This observation has been applied often.[17] Kirby J said in <em>Johnson v Johnson</em>:[18]<br />"Such considerations lay behind the salutary warning given in <em>Re JRL; Ex parte JRL </em>that judicial officers in Australia were obliged to discharge their professional duties unless disqualified by law. They were told not to accede too readily to suggestions of an appearance of bias, lest parties be encouraged to seek such disqualification without justification. Applications of that kind might sometimes be made in the hope of securing an adjudicator more sympathetic to a party’s cause. Or they might be made because of the strategic advantage that may thereby be secured, especially the interruption of lengthy proceedings and the delays consequent upon obtaining a fresh start in a busy court or tribunal."<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;In respect to the warning by the High Court not to readily accede to such applications, I refer to the decision of the High Court in <em>Re Polites; Ex parte Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd (No. 2)</em>.[19] In that case, Deputy President Polites and others were sitting as a Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearing a number of matters relating to the terms and conditions of employment of employees of the Hoyts Corporation Pty Ltd. Mr Polites, when he was a solicitor, had advised Hoyts and he acceded to an application that he should disqualify himself from sitting. On appeal, the High Court held that he should not have disqualified himself. <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;It is not said that I have said anything or done anything which could conceivably amount to pre-judgment of any of the issues in this application. It is not said that I have any association with any of the parties and accordingly could not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the issues. It is not said that I have some bias through interest in any of the issues. It is put that the reasonable fair-minded observer sitting in the back of the Court would think it unfair if I refused the application, taking into account that on the Friday before the principal disappeared, I had refused to revoke bail. It is said that the surety would rely upon the fact, namely, that the judge refused to revoke the bail, as a form of comfort and security to her that the principal would honour his bail. That may or may not be so and that may be a fact relevant to the issues. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;But in considering that fact in the application, in my view, it does not involve any question of criticism of the reasons why the judge refused to revoke the bail. The fact was that I did so on the material before me. It is said that I may be seen to be punishing the surety because later events showed that the refusal to revoke the bail was wrong, and this would be seen to be unfair. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;However, in my view, that is not the test. It is not whether the impartial observer may think that it was unfair that the judge refused to revoke the bail, and then refused an application to vary or rescind the order forfeiting bail and ordering the surety to pay a substantial sum of money and, in default, imprisonment. The test is that a judge should not sit to hear a case "if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might entertain a reasonable apprehension that he might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question involved in it".[20] <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Lasry disavowed any suggestion of actual bias. I can say categorically that I will have no difficulty in considering and determining the issues raised in this application in accordance with the law and the facts as I find them, and I am not in any way embarrassed in performing my judicial function by reason of the fact that later events showed that my failure to revoke bail was wrong.<br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, the reasonable hypothetical observer seated in the back of the Court and having the necessary knowledge of all relevant matters, would not entertain a reasonable apprehension that I could not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the questions involved in this application. If the application is refused and that is the outcome of it, it does not follow that it would be unfair. In my view, it would not be viewed as unfair by the fair-minded observer with knowledge of the material objective facts. The fact is that the bail was not revoked, and the surety seeks to rely upon that fact in the present application. On the basis that it is relevant to an issue in the application, she is entitled to do so. It does not appear to me to be relevant to any issue in this application that the reasons given by the judge turned out to be wrong. If she was aware of the reasons given then she may be able to rely upon them. No doubt she can rely upon them, if relevant, to show that the judge did not see any concern about the principal’s attendance at Court the following week. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, the reasonable, fair minded observer would not conclude that in the circumstances, I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues in the application. Accordingly, I reject the application and the matter will proceed before me.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See [2006] VSC 119. <br />[2] See [2006] VSC 158. <br />[3] [1973] VR 427. <br />[4] at p429. <br />[5] [1983] 2 VR 250. <br />[6] See observations at p251 per Crockett J. <br />[7] [2006] 80 ALJR 497. <br />[8] (2000) 201 CLR 488 at paragraph 11. <br />[9] At paragraph 11. <br />[10] At paragraph 12. <br />[11] At paragraph 13. <br />[12] (1994) 181 CLR 41. <br />[13] At p73. <br />[14] Supra at p493. <br />[15] (1986) 161 CLR 342. <br />[16] At p352. <br />[17] See <em>Johnson v Johnson</em>, supra at paragraphs 45 and 48. <br />[18] At paragraph 45. <br />[19] (1991) 173 CLR 78. <br />[20] Per the High Court in <em>Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association </em>(1983) 151 CLR 288 at 293-4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the Crown (Commonwealth of Australia and State of Victoria): Mr D Parsons SC, counsel.

It was alleged he was drink/driving and speeding. As the BAC was less than 0.07, an infringement notice for that and the speeding offence was issued. S. incurred a total of 13 demerit points. Subsequently, S. was served with an option notice under s25(3) of the Road Safety Act 1986 (Act) which gave S. the option to accept an immediate suspension of his driver licence for 3 months or extend the demerit point period for 12 months. S. opted to extend the period for 12 months in full knowledge that if he re-offended within that period he would lose his driver licence for 6 months.</p>\r\n<p>During the extended period, S. was found guilty of a speeding offence thereby incurring a further 3 demerit points. Accordingly, VicRoads suspended Ss driver licence for 6 months. S. appealed to the Magistrates Court under s26(1)(c) of the Act and contended that as the 0.05 infringement notice did not comply with the applicable regulations, the notice was misleading in form and accordingly, the notice was invalid. The magistrate agreed with this submission, upheld Ss appeal and directed VicRoads to remove from the Demerits Register the 10 demerit points associated with the 0.05 infringement notice. Upon appliation for judicial review—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Application granted. Remitted to the Magistrates Court for rehearing and determination according to law. </p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Whether or not the 0.05 infringement notice was misleading in that it did not refer to the fact that under amending legislation there was a 10 demerit point penalty for driving with a blood alcohol concentration between 0.05 and 0.07, was not to the point. Once an infringement notice includes all of the prescribed particulars under the regulations, it is a valid notice. If it is misleading in a material way, then the recipient of such a notice can elect to object to it and take his or her chances in court. This may or may not lead to a conviction and, if it does, may or may not lead to a different penalty being imposed to that stated in the relevant infringement notice. However, unless the charge resulting from an objection to an infringement notice which complies with the regulations is dismissed, the infringement notice remains an infringement notice for the purposes of the statutory regime under consideration. It follows that VicRoads was obliged to record the applicable demerit points against the driver referred to in the notice and otherwise follow the mandatory provisions of the Act.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;The legislature has expressly limited, in a very narrow way, the grounds of appeal available to a driver whose driver’s licence is suspended under s25(3B)(a) of the Act. Parliament has done so in plain and unambiguous language. Where the identity of the driver is not in issue, as in this case, then the scope of the appeal under s26(1)(c) of the Act is limited to “miscalculation” in the assessment of the relevant number of demerit points attributable to the the driver. The choice of the term “miscalculation” limits the scope of appeal to, and provides a “safety net” in respect of, errors made in the calculation of demerit points attributable to the driver whose licence has been suspended. It would be straining the language of s26(2)(b) to an impermissible extent to interpret it as permitting an inquiry as to whether an infringement notice which was served on the correct driver, and which contained all of the prescribed particulars, was nevertheless “invalid”. An appeal under s26(1)(c) could not be based upon an allegation that the relevant infringement notice did not contain all of the prescribed particulars as required by the regulations made under s88(1) of the Act. The recipient of a defective notice has the remedy of objecting to the notice and taking his or her chances in court when a charge is laid. Acccordingly, the magistrate exceeded the courts jurisdiction in accepting the arguments advanced by S. and determining the appeal is his favour. &nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>HARGRAVE J:<br />Background and Facts<br />1.&nbsp;In this proceeding, the first defendant, trading as VicRoads (“VicRoads”), seeks by Originating Motion under Order 56 of the Rules of the Supreme Court, to challenge the decision of the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria to allow an appeal by the second defendant (“Sear”) made pursuant to s26(1)(c) of the Road Safety Act 1986 (“the Act”). The appeal by Sear arose out of the following factual circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;On 21 February 2002, Sear was intercepted driving a motor vehicle. It was alleged that he was speeding and that he was drink-driving. As a result, a member of the Victoria Police issued Sear with two traffic infringement notices. First, a traffic infringement notice alleging that Sear had driven a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of above 0.05 grams per 100 millilitres of blood but below 0.07 grams per 100 millilitres (“the 0.05 infringement notice”). Second, a traffic infringement notice alleging that Sear had driven a motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit by more than 15 kph but less than 30 kph (“the speeding infringement notice”). </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Under the demerit points regime contained in the Act, as explained hereafter, Sear incurred, and VicRoads was obliged to record against him in its Demerits Register, a total of 13 demerit points for the two offences described in the infringement notices The 0.05 offence attracted 10 demerit points and the speeding offence attracted 3 demerit point. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;As Sear had incurred 12 or more demerit points, VicRoads was required under s25(3) of the Act to serve a notice on Sear. It did so (the “option notice”). The option notice gave Sear an option to accept an immediate suspension of his driving licence for three months or to extend the “demerit point period” for twelve months By virtue of s25(3C) of the Act, if Sear extended the demerit point period, and incurred no further demerit points during the twelve month extended demerit point period, his licence would not be suspended and the demerit points previously incurred would thereafter be disregarded. However, under s25(3B) of the Act, if Sear did incur one or more demerit points during the extended twelve month demerit point period, VicRoads would be required to suspend his licence for a minimum of six months. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp; Sear elected to extend the demerit point period. During that period, he was charged with speeding. He was found guilty and thereby incurred a further 3 demerit points As a result, on 1 December 2003, VicRoads suspended his licence pursuant to s25(3B) of the Act. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;On 19 January 2004, Sear appealed to the Magistrates’ Court pursuant to s26(1)(c) of the Act against the suspension of his licence. The appeal was heard on 29 April and 21 May 2004. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;In his appeal to the Magistrates’ Court, Sear contended that the 0.05 infringement notice did not comply with the applicable regulations made pursuant to s88(2) of the Act and that the notice was misleading in form. Accordingly, it was submitted that the 0.05 notice was “invalid”. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The magistrate did not accept that the 0.05 notice failed to comply with the Regulations. However, she found that the 0.05 notice was nevertheless “invalid” because it prevented Sear from making a fully informed decision as to whether to challenge it. On this basis, the magistrate allowed the appeal against the suspension of Sear’s licence and directed VicRoads to remove from its Demerits Register the 10 demerit points associated with the 0.05 infringement notice. The magistrate also ordered VicRoads to pay Sear’s costs of the appeal. </p>\r\n<p>Nature of this Proceeding<br />9.&nbsp;VicRoads seeks to review the decision of the Magistrates’ Court pursuant to Order 56 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The grounds of review relied on are jurisdictional error and error of law on the face of the record. In summary, VicRoads contends that, by reason of the limitations contained in s26(2) of the Act on appeals under s26(1)(c) of the Act, the Magistrates’ Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the grounds of appeal put forward by Sear and accepted by the magistrate. Accordingly, VicRoads seeks an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Magistrates’ Court and an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the Magistrates’ Court to hear and determine the appeal by Sear under s26 of the Act according to law. </p>\r\n<p>Relevant Provisions of the Act<br />10.&nbsp;It is first relevant to note that, until December 2001, the Act required the automatic suspension of the licence of any driver found driving with in excess of 0.05 grams per 100 millilitres of alcohol in his or her blood. However, by s12 of the Road Safety (Further Amendment) Act 2001 (Act No. 92 of 2001) s25 of the Act was amended. It introduced a regime whereby drivers with a blood alcohol concentration of between 0.05 and 0.07 may or may not lose their licences depending upon their driving record as measured by the demerit points system. This was effectuated by introducing s25(2A) and (2B) into the Act. These provided for 10 demerit points to be incurred by a driver found driving with a blood alcohol concentration of between 0.05 and 0.07. I note that this is just below the twelve point trigger for the service of a notice under s25(3) of the Act, as set out below. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;The statutory purpose of these amendments may be ascertained from the Explanatory Memorandum to the Road Safety (Further Amendment) Act 2001. It is there stated in relation to s12, among other things: <br />“Section 12 inserts new sub-sections (2A) and (2B) into section 25 of the Principal Act. Under new section 25(2A), any drink-driver whose licence is not cancelled will incur 10 demerit points.</p>\r\n<p>Taken together, sections 12, 14 and 25 are intended to achieve greater equity as regards licence loss penalties imposed on first-offender drink-drivers Those whose blood alcohol concentration (‘BAC’) is just above the legal limit may or may not lose their licences, depending on whether they have good or bad driving records (as measured by the demerit points system). Those whose BAC is well above the legal limit will lose their licences In both cases, there will be greater parity as between those who accept an infringement notice and those found guilty by a Court.</p>\r\n<p>To understand how the proposed scheme is intended to achieve this object, it is necessary to understand how the demerit scheme already operates –</p>\r\n<p>•&nbsp;First, a person who accrues 12 points in any 3 year period is liable to have his or her licence suspended for 3 months There is an additional one month’s suspension for every 4 points (or part) over 12. Thus, a person with, say, 17 points (5 more than 12) would be liable to licence suspension for 2 more months, making 5 months in total. <br />•&nbsp;However, any person in this situation has a choice. They can accept licence suspension for a period calculated as above. Or, they can opt to keep their licence. But if the person takes this option they cannot incur any more demerits for 12 months If they do, their licence is automatically suspended for twice as long as it would have been suspended otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>The effect of the proposed section 25(2A), therefore, is that drink-drivers whose licences are not cancelled may or may not have their licences suspended, depending on their individual driving records.</p>\r\n<p>A person with no prior demerits would not face immediate suspension, but would incur 10 demerits and would have to drive responsibly in future to avoid risking their licence. A person who already had fewer than 12 demerits could accept suspension, or could choose the ‘double or nothing’ option. A person who was already on ‘double or nothing’ would have their licence suspended.”</p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;It is necessary to set out the applicable legislative regime at the relevant time (there have been amendments since) in some detail. I do so by reference to Reprint No. 7 of the Act. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;Section 24 of the Act provided as follows: <br />“24. Cancellation, suspension or variation of licences and permits by Corporation<br />(1) The Corporation must, if required by the regulations or section 25 to do so—<br />(a) suspend for the prescribed time the driver licence or permit of any person;<br />(b) cancel the driver licence or permit of any person;<br />(c) vary the driver licence or permit of any person by excluding or including a category of motor vehicle;<br />(d) vary the conditions to which the driver licence or permit of any person is subject by imposing, removing or amending a condition.<br />(2) The Corporation may, in accordance with the regulations –<br />(a) suspend for any time that it thinks fit the driver licence or permit of any person;<br />(b) cancel the driver licence or permit of any person;<br />(c) vary the driver licence or permit of any person by excluding or including a category of motor vehicle;<br />(d) vary the conditions to which the driver licence or permit of any person is subject by imposing, removing or amending a condition.<br />(3) In suspending, in accordance with the regulations, a driver licence or permit on the ground that it would be dangerous for the person to drive a motor vehicle because of illness or bodily infirmity, defect or incapacity or because of the effects of treatment for any of those things, the Corporation may do so on the basis of a report given by a registered medical practitioner and without conducting any other hearing or investigation into the matter before the suspension is imposed.”</p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;It can be seen that s24 deals with a variety of circumstances in which VicRoads is obliged to, or has a discretion to, deal with a driver’s licence. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Section 25 of the Act provided: <br />“25. Demerits Register<br />(1) The Corporation must keep a Demerits Register and must record against a person any demerit points that are incurred by that person.<br />(2) The circumstances in which demerit points are incurred, the number of points incurred the determination of the date on which points are to be recorded as incurred and the circumstances in which, if points are incurred before a conviction or finding of guilt is recorded or made, the points may be cancelled are as prescribed.<br />(2A) Without limiting sub-section (2), the Corporation must, in respect of the day on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, record 10 demerit points against a person –<br />(a) who is found guilty of an offence under section 49(1)(b), (f) or (g) but the court does not record a conviction and, in accordance with section 50(1AB), does not cancel the person’s driver licence or permit; or <br />(b) who is convicted or found guilty of an offence under section 49(1)(b), (f) or (g) in circumstances in which section 50(1) applies and the court does not cancel the person’s driver licence or permit; or <br />(c) to whom a traffic infringement notice has been issued in respect of a drink-driving infringement if –<br />(i) no notice of objection to the infringement notice has been given and the 28 day period referred to in section 89C has expired; and <br />(ii) the person’s driver licence or permit is not cancelled by force of section 89C(1).<br />(2B) Nothing in sub-section (2A) prevents regulations being made under a power conferred by this Act that make provision to the same effect as that sub-section.<br />(3) The Corporation must serve a notice containing the prescribed particulars on the holder of a driver licence or learner permit who incurs 12 or more demerit points within any 3 year period.<br />(3A) A person on whom that notice is served may, within 21 days after service of the notice, notify the Corporation that he or she elects to extend the demerit point period.<br />(3B) If a person notifies the Corporation under sub-section (3A) that he or she elects to extend the demerit point period, the Corporation must, if the person incurs 1 or more additional demerit points in relation to any offence committed within the 12 month period commencing on the date determined by the Corporation and specified in the notice served under sub-section (3) as the commencement date of the 12 month period –<br />(a) suspend his or her driver licence or learner permit for 6 months and an additional 2 months for each 4 demerit points in excess of 12 recorded against the person as at the date of issue of the notice under sub-section (3); and <br />(b) when calculating demerit points recorded against that person at any time after the end of the period of suspension, disregard all demerit points recorded against the person as at the date of issue of the notice under sub-section (3); and <br />(c) serve on the person a notice containing the prescribed particulars.<br />(3C) If a person notifies the Corporation under sub-section (3A) that he or she elects to extend the demerit point period, the Corporation must, if the person incurs no additional demerit points in relation to any offence committed within the 12 month period commencing on the date determined by the Corporation and specified in the notice served under sub-section (3) as the commencement date of the 12 month period, when calculating demerit points recorded against that person at any time after the end of that 12 month period, disregard all demerit points recorded against that person as at the date of issue of the notice under sub-section (3).<br />(3D) If a person on whom a notice under sub-section (3) is served does not, in accordance with sub-section (3A), notify the Corporation that he or she elects to extend the demerit point period, the Corporation must—<br />(a) suspend his or her driver licence or learner permit for 3 months and an additional 1 month for each 4 demerit points in excess of 12 recorded against the person as at the date of issue of the notice under sub-section (3); and <br />(b) when calculating demerit points recorded against that person at any time after the end of the period of suspension, disregard all demerit points recorded against the person as at the date of issue of the notice under sub-section (3).<br />(4) The suspension of a driver licence or learner permit under this section takes effect on and from the date determined by the Corporation and specified in the notice served under sub-section (3) or (3B)(c).”</p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;The relevant provision for this case is s25(2A)(c). It obliges VicRoads to record 10 demerit points against any person “to whom a traffic infringement notice has been issued in respect of a drink-driving infringement.” </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Section 88 of the Act provides for the issuing of traffic infringement notices. There is no definition in the Act of a “traffic infringement notice”. Section 88(2) provides that every traffic infringement notice must contain the prescribed particulars. The prescribed particulars are contained in reg.603(1) of the Road Safety (General) Regulations 1999. I will not set these out. There is no dispute that the 0.05 infringement notice contained the prescribed particulars. Further, the magistrate found this to be the case. Rather, the contention on behalf of Sear, which was accepted by the magistrate, is that the 0.05 infringement notice was misleading and therefore “invalid”. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;Section 89C provides for cancellation of licences, and prescribed periods of disqualification from obtaining a new licence, for drink-driving offences where no notice of objection is given within 28 days of the traffic infringement notice. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;Section 26 of the Act provided at relevant times: <br />“26. Appeal to Magistrates’ Court<br />(1) If the Corporation decides to—<br />(a) refuse an application for a driver licence, a driver licence variation or a permit; or<br />(b) in accordance with section 24, suspend, cancel or vary in any way a driver licence or permit; or<br />(c) in accordance with section 25(3B)(a) or (3D)(a), suspend a driver licence or learner permit – <br />the applicant or holder may, in accordance with the regulations and subject to sub-section (2), appeal against that decision to the Magistrates’ Court.<br />(2) An appeal under sub-section (1)(c) may only be made on either or both of the following grounds:<br />(a) That the appellant was not the person against whom the Corporation was required by this Act and the regulations to record certain demerit points;<br />(b) That a miscalculation has been made in assessing the total number of demerit points incurred by the appellant.<br />(3) The giving, in accordance with the regulations, of a notice of appeal under sub-section (1)(c) stays the suspension of the licence or learner permit until—<br />(a) the date on which the appeal is determined; or<br />(b) if the appeal is discontinued, the date on which notice in writing of discontinuance is given in accordance with the regulations to both the Magistrates’ Court and the Corporation.<br />(4) On an appeal under sub-section (1) the court must—<br />(a) re-determine the matter of the refusal, suspension, cancellation or variation; and <br />(b) hear any relevant evidence tendered by the appellant or the Corporation; and <br />(c) without limiting its discretion, take into consideration anything that the Corporation ought to have considered.<br />(5) If the court is satisfied that the refusal, suspension, cancellation or variation—<br />(a) results from a driving disqualification of the appellant in another State or Territory of the Commonwealth; or<br />(b) was required by the regulations or section 25—<br />the court must confirm the decision of the Corporation.<br />(6) On an appeal under sub-section (1)(c) the court may—<br />(a) in allowing the appeal, give to the Corporation any directions it thinks proper for the amendment of the Demerits Register; or <br />(b) in dismissing the appeal, order that the suspension take effect from a date specified in the order.<br />(7) Every decision of the Magistrates’ Court on an appeal under this section is final and conclusive and must be given effect to by the Corporation.”</p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;The first thing to note about s26 is that it provides for appeals in a wide variety of circumstances, not just in respect of suspensions of licences under the demerit points system. The appeal process which is provided for extends to the refusal of an application for a licence and any suspension, cancellation or variation of a licence by VicRoads which is required or permitted under s24. The decisions which can be the subject of appeal under s26(1) include both mandatory decisions required by s24(1) and discretionary decisions required by s24(2) and (3). This includes, for example, a discretionary suspension due to a medical condition under s24(3). </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;It is next necessary to note that the right of appeal granted by s26(1) is expressly subject to sub-s(2). The issue in this proceeding is the extent of the limitation provided for in sub-s(2)(b). Sub-section (2)(a) is not relevant. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;There is some authority on the scope of the right of appeal under s26(1)(c) of the Act. In Roads Corporation v The Magistrates Court of Victoria; Parsons and Holloway[1] Smith J considered two appeals under s26(1)(c). Each appeal concerned the identity of the person against whom VicRoads was required to record demerit points. In other words, the extent of the limitation in s26(2)(a) of the Act. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Smith J accepted that s26(2)(a) was directed at the realities of the situation and allowed an inquiry, on appeal, as to who was in fact driving the relevant vehicle at the time of the alleged offence. His Honour pointed to the practicalities and risk of error and stated, at [24]:<br />&nbsp;<br />“One might expect the Parliament to seek to introduce a safety net for those who find out for the first time that they have received demerit points when their licences are about to be, or have been, suspended. Driving licences, while a privilege, can be critical to people’s livelihoods. Suspension of a licence can have catastrophic consequences for licence holders. It will also, in my view, be surprising if an appeal procedure to the Magistrates’ Court should have been set up to deal only with clerical errors when those responsible for the drafting of the legislation would have been well aware that the system carried with it the risk of serious injustice where the owner was not in fact the driver who infringed.”[2]</p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;Smith J also briefly considered the scope of the limitation on appeals in s26(2)(b). His Honour accepted that the normal meaning of the term “miscalculation” is to “calculate wrongly”, or “wrong or faulty calculation”.[3] This dictum, based on dictionary meanings of the word “miscalculation”, was relied upon by VicRoads as establishing that s26(2)(b) limits appeals under s26(1)(c) to cases of mistaken arithmetic. I accept that Smith J was of this view, but he certainly did not decide the issue as it was not before him. It is this very issue that I must decide in this proceeding. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;On behalf of VicRoads, it was argued that the magistrate exceeded her jurisdiction by entertaining and deciding the appeal by Sears on the ground that the 0.05 notice was “invalid”. Mr Cavanough QC, who appeared with Ms Hubble, for VicRoads, argued, in summary, that:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) The Magistrates’ Court is a statutory court of limited jurisdiction.<br />(2) For the purposes of the present case, its jurisdiction was exhaustively stated in s26 of the Act as it stood at the relevant time.<br />(3) As the appeal was pursuant to s26(1)(c), it was limited by s26(2).<br />(4) Section 26(2) of the Act had a narrow operation and, insofar as relevant to this case, was limited to “miscalculation” or arithmetical errors only.<br />(5) The magistrate was not authorised to entertain, let alone decide, the appeal on the ground that the 0.05 infringement notice was “invalid”. This was beyond her jurisdiction.[4] <br />(6) Section 26(4) did not have the effect of broadening the scope of an appeal under s26(1)(c), as limited by s26(2). The broad nature of s26(4) was explained by the fact that it had a lot of work to do, or acted “distributively”, in relation to all appeals under s26(1).</p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;On behalf of Sear, Mr Haag and Mr Strahan argued that:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) The 0.05 infringement notice was misleading because it gave Sear the clear impression that, if he paid the $300 fine specified therein, that would be the end of the matter and his driver’s licence would not be affected.<br />(2) Section 26(4) informed the construction which ought to be placed upon s26(2) and, in particular, 26(2)(b). It was submitted that s26(4) had the effect that the Magistrates’ Court, on the hearing of an appeal, was required and entitled to inquire into the validity of every aspect of the process leading to the incurring of the relevant demerit points, except for an enquiry into the merits of the alleged offence or offences stated in the relevant infringement notices This included, so it was argued, whether or not a notice was in fact issued and, if so, whether it was a valid or invalid notice. </p>\r\n<p>Alleged misleading nature of the 0.05 infringement notice<br />26.&nbsp;As I have said, the magistrate found, and it was accepted before me, that the 0.05 infringement notice contained all of the prescribed particulars required by the regulations. However, there is one aspect of the prescribed particulars which bears upon the allegation that the 0.05 infringement notice was misleading. Regulation 603(1)(g)(ii) prescribes that a traffic infringement notice relating to an alleged drink-driving infringement must state that, unless a notice of objection is received at the address specified in the notice within 28 days after service of the notice, the notice will take effect as a conviction and will result in cancellation or suspension of the licence or permit of the person on whom it is served. This requirement was a reflection of the position as it stood before the insertion of s25(2A) and (2B) into the Act by the Road Safety (Further Amendment) Act 2001. It does not take any account of the limited option arising from the service of an option notice under s25(3). </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;In fact, the form of the 0.05 infringement notice reflected the legislative regime prior to the commencement of s25(2A) and (2B) of the Act.[5] In the first place, under the heading “DEMERIT POINTS (DRIVER’S LICENCES)” on the reverse side of the form, it is stated that:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Some traffic offences have both a monetary penalty and a Demerit Points penalty. Accruing 12 Demerit Points within any 3 year period may affect your right to drive. VIC ROADS can advise you of the number of Demerit Points that you have on your licence.”</p>\r\n<p>There then follows a table setting out a broad range of driving offences and the relevant demerit points applicable to each offence. There is no reference in the table to the offence of driving with a blood alcohol concentration of above 0.05 grams per 100 millilitres of blood but below 0.07 grams per 100 millilitres, or to the fact that, under the new legislative regime, such an offence attracted 10 demerit points. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;Secondly, also on the reverse of the form, under the heading “DRIVER LICENCE LOSS INFRINGEMENTS” it is stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Unless you lodge a Notice of Objection to Civic Compliance Victoria in time, the infringement will take effect as a conviction and the suspension or cancellation of your right to drive will apply 28 days after the date of this notice.”</p>\r\n<p>This part of the form would appear to relate to the box on the front page of the form headed “ADDITIONAL PENALTY FOR A DRIVER’S LICENCE LOSS INFRINGEMENT EFFECTIVE 28 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS NOTICE”. In the box bearing this bold heading, there is provision for the police officer completing the notice to indicate whether a driver’s licence will be suspended or cancelled after the 28 day period and, if so, to insert the number of months for which the driver will be disqualified from driving. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;Counsel for Sear submitted that the failure of the form of infringement notice to catch-up with the changes to the legislation, combined with other statements on the 0.05 infringement notice, rendered it misleading so that it deprived Sear of the ability to make a fully informed decision as to whether to lodge a Notice of Objection to the 0.05 infringement notice within the 28 day period. In summary, the following aspects of the 0.05 infringement notice were relied upon to render it misleading:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) The omission of the 0.05 infringement notice to refer to the fact that, under the legislation as amended, there was a 10 demerit point penalty for driving with a blood alcohol concentration of between 0.05 and 0.07. This, it was said, amounted to a representation that no demerit points would be incurred for the offence identified in the 0.05 infringement notice. <br />(2) The fact that, on the front page of the notice, the police officer completing it placed a dash in the period of disqualification box and gave no indication that Sear’s driver’s licence would be either suspended or cancelled effective 28 days after the date of the notice. It was submitted, in effect, that, the combination of (1) and (2) meant that the reference to “DRIVER LICENCE LOSS INFRINGEMENTS” on the reverse page was represented to Sear as having no application to the offence alleged against him.<br />(3) Under the heading “IF YOU PAY ON TIME” on the reverse page of the notice, it was stated that:<br />“For all persons except Licensees Nominees and Directors under the Liquor Control Act, the matter is finished. It will not go to court.” <br />This, it was submitted, amounted to a representation that, if the fine stated in the notice was paid on time, the matter would go no further and there would be no further consequences for Sear arising out of the alleged offence.<br />(4) Also on the reverse side of the notice, under the heading “EFFECT ON DRIVER’S LICENCES” it is stated that:<br />“If this infringement notice is for exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol and the blood alcohol reading is 0.100 per cent or less, a different decision may be made by a Court.”</p>\r\n<p>It was submitted that this bolstered the impression created by the statement referred to in (3) above that the offence alleged in the notice would carry no further consequences unless it was considered by a court following a notice of objection. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;There is some force in the submission that the form of the 0.05 infringement notice was, in the circumstances of the case, misleading, for one or more of the reasons submitted on behalf of Sear. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;Whether or not the 0.05 infringement notice was misleading is not, however, to the point. In my opinion, once an infringement notice includes all of the prescribed particulars under the regulations, it is a valid notice. If it is misleading in a material way, then the recipient of such a notice can elect to object to it and take his or her chances in court. This may or may not lead to a conviction and, if it does, may or may not lead to a different penalty being imposed to that stated in the relevant infringement notice. However, unless the charge resulting from an objection to an infringement notice which complies with the regulations is dismissed, the infringement notice remains, in my view, an infringement notice for the purposes of the statutory regime under consideration. It follows that VicRoads will be obliged to record the applicable demerit points against the driver referred to in the notice and otherwise follow the mandatory provisions of the Act. </p>\r\n<p>Interpretation of s26(2)(b)<br />32.&nbsp;On behalf of Sear, it was argued that the effect of s26(4) was to override the express words of s26(2), so that the Magistrates’ Court, on appeal, was not limited to an inquiry as to whether there was a relevant infringement notice containing the prescribed particulars, and an examination of the calculation of the applicable demerit points, but could also inquire into whether the notice complied with the statutory purpose underlying the applicable legislative regime. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;In this regard, reliance was placed upon Director of Public Prosecutions v Korybutiak[6] in which Chernov JA, speaking for the Court of Appeal, said in respect of infringement notices:<br />&nbsp;<br />“It seems that the legislation now under consideration seeks to strike a balance between the need to streamline the procedure for disposing of infringement notices without resort to the courts, on the one hand, and, on the other, the need to preserve the right of the alleged offender to have the matter determined by the courts. Thus, the legislation prescribes a range of penalties that are to apply to specified infringements committed in particular contexts and places on the alleged offender the onus of electing, within a limited period, to contest in court the police allegations as to the infringement. It is in that context that the legislation has prescribed what information must be provided to the alleged offender in the notice of infringement in order to enable him or her to make an informed decision whether to make the election to go to court.”[7]</p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;Mr Haag submitted that, if an infringement notice was misleading in any respect, or did not contain all of the information upon which a recipient might require to make an informed decision, that it would be an “invalid” notice which would not constitute a traffic infringement notice for purposes of the Act. </p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;In my view, the submissions on behalf of VicRoads are to be preferred. The legislature has expressly limited, in a very narrow way, the grounds of appeal available to a driver whose driver’s licence is suspended under s25(3B)(a). Parliament has done so in plain and unambiguous language. <br />36.&nbsp;Where identity of the driver in question is in issue, that issue may be explored in full on appeal. In this respect, I agree with the decision of Smith J in Parsons and Holloway, as discussed above. </p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;Where the identity of the driver is not in issue, as in this case, then the scope of the appeal under s26(1)(c) is limited to “miscalculation” in the assessment of the relevant number of demerit points attributable to the appellant. The choice of the term “miscalculation”, in my view, limits the scope of appeal to, and provides a “safety net” in respect of, errors made in the calculation of demerit points attributable to the appellant whose licence has been suspended. </p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;Demerit points arise from the service of an infringement notice or, if objection is taken, a conviction following a charge. Once demerit points are incurred, it is necessary that the raw information be collated by VicRoads in its Demerits Register required to be maintained by s25(1) of the Act. In maintaining that register, VicRoads must rely upon information which it receives from others, in particular Civic Compliance Victoria which, in turn, must rely upon the Victoria Police and others responsible for the issue of infringement notices. </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;There are many opportunities for errors to be made. No doubt the register is maintained by computer, thus increasing the scope for error in the course of processing data on the computer system. Infringement notices consist of standard forms on which are completed, in handwriting, the essential details enabling the calculation of demerit points and the allocation of those points to the driver in question. There is much scope for error as to matters such as the date of the alleged offence and the particulars of the offence. For example, an error in the date of the offence could mean the difference between demerit points being incurred within a relevant three year period or outside of it. A mistake as to the alleged speed could result in a higher number of demerit points being allocated than was appropriate. </p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;In my view, it is against this kind of error that Parliament intended to provide a safety net by providing for appeals in respect of any “miscalculation”. It would be straining the language of s26(2)(b) to an impermissible extent to interpret it as permitting an inquiry as to whether an infringement notice which was served on the correct driver, and which contained all of the prescribed particulars, was nevertheless “invalid”. One asks, where would the line of “invalidity” be drawn? By the use of language limiting the appeal to the ground of “miscalculation”, Parliament could not have intended an inquiry such as that contended for on behalf of Sear. </p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;As to the submission on behalf of Sear that the broad terms of s26(4) are inconsistent with giving s26(2)(b) its ordinary meaning, I accept the submission on behalf of VicRoads that s26(4) must be read subject to s26(2). The right of appeal under s26(1)(c) is expressly made subject to s26(2). Accordingly, s26(4) only applies to an appeal under s26(1)(c) to the extent that it is consistent with the limitations placed on that appeal by s26(2). Thus, where there is no issue as to the identity of the driver, and the appeal grounds are limited by s24(2)(b):<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) the re-determination spoken of in s26(4)(a) is a re-determination in the sense of a re-calculation if any error in calculation can be shown;</p>\r\n<p>(2) the evidence which is admissible on appeal under s26(4)(b) is limited to evidence which is relevant to the question of calculation, and not otherwise;</p>\r\n<p>(3) s26(4)(c) has no work to do, because there is no discretion involved in the decision of VicRoads to suspend a driver licence in accordance with either s25(3B)(a) or (3D)(a). </p>\r\n<p>42.&nbsp;In my opinion, the above reasoning applies irrespective of whether the 0.05 infringement notice in this case was misleading as contended for on behalf of Sear. Furthermore, although it is not necessary for me to decide it, it is my view that an appeal under s26(1)(c) could not be based upon an allegation that the relevant infringement notice did not contain all of the prescribed particulars as required by the regulations made under s88(1) of the Act. In my opinion, the recipient of a defective notice has the remedy of objecting to the notice and taking his or her chances in court when a charge is laid. To hold otherwise would leave open the distinct possibility that, with the effluxion of time involved with appeals, an alleged offender could escape all liability due to the statutory time limit of 12 months for prosecution for summary offences provided for by s26(4) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989[8]. <br />Discretionary Considerations<br />43.&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of Sear that the relief which VicRoads is seeking in this proceeding is discretionary. I accept that this is so. It was then submitted that I should refuse the relief sought by VicRoads in the exercise of my discretion because the evidence before the magistrate, which was accepted, was that Sear was in fact misled by the 0.05 infringement notice and elected not to serve a notice of objection based on the belief that there would be no effect on his driver’s licence if he paid the fine of $300 stated on the notice. </p>\r\n<p>44.&nbsp;It seems that there is a factual basis for this submission. The magistrate did find that, at the time he paid the fine of $300, Sear believed that his choice was between paying that fine and going to court and risking a higher penalty than the fine.[9] </p>\r\n<p>45.&nbsp;However, that is not an end of the relevant factual history. Albeit after a delay of some seven months, Sear received an option notice under s25(3) of the Act. Whatever may have been the position before that time, Sear then knew that he had incurred 13 demerit points and that, unless he extended the demerit point period for 12 months, his driving licence would be suspended for three months. He also knew that, if he re-offended within the extended 12 month period, he would lose his licence for a period of six months. On receipt of this notice, Sear elected to extend the demerit point period. He did so in full knowledge of the consequences for his licence if he re-offended within that extended 12 month period. He did re-offend and was issued with a further infringement notice. This time, he objected. The charge was heard and a conviction for speeding resulted. A further three demerit points were incurred. As a result, VicRoads was obliged under s25(3B) of the Act to suspend the driver’s licence of Sear for a period of six months. This is what has occurred. </p>\r\n<p>46.&nbsp;In light of the conduct of Sear after the receipt of the option notice, I do not believe that it is appropriate for me to refuse relief to VicRoads in the exercise of my discretion. I am also mindful in reaching this view that this case involves a drink-driving offence. The seriousness of the offence of drink-driving, and the opprobrium attaching to such conduct by parliament and the community generally, are notorious. Although some very limited latitude has been introduced by the amendments to the statutory scheme discussed in this judgment, Parliament ought not to be taken to have intended to thereby provide further grounds for technical arguments to escape the penalties which Parliament intended for such offences. </p>\r\n<p>Appropriate Relief<br />47.&nbsp;The Magistrates’ Court exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the arguments put on behalf of Mr Sear and determining his appeal under s26(1)(c) of the Act on those grounds. There is an error of law on the face of the record, constituted by the oral reasons of the magistrate to allow the appeal by Sear on those grounds[10]. Accordingly, I propose to order that:<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp;The decision of the first defendant made on 21 May 2004, whereby the first defendant allowed the appeal of the second defendant under s26 of the Road Safety Act 1986 (“the Act”) against the decision of the plaintiff to suspend the second defendant’s driver licence and to direct the plaintiff to remove from its Demerits Register 10 demerit points which it had recorded against the second defendant pursuant to s25 of the Act in respect of Traffic Infringement Notice 0308725045 dated 21 February 2002 and to require the plaintiff to pay the second defendant’s costs, be set aside. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The matter be referred back to the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria for re-hearing and determination according to law. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;There be no order as to costs.[11]<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the Plaintiff Roads Corporation: Mr A Cavanough QC and Ms G Hubble, counsel.

The jury must be properly instructed that if they are left unable to reject the evidence of the accused, although they do not positively accept it, they could not find guilt established beyond reasonable doubt, and even if the evidence of the accused is rejected attention must still be given to the important question whether the evidence of the complainant, or so much of it as the jury do accept, establishes the commission of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.<br />&nbsp;<em>Liberato v The Queen </em>(1985) 159 CLR 507; and<br />&nbsp;<em>Crisafio v The Queen </em>(2003) 141 A Crim R 98, applied.<br />2.&nbsp;For a jury to be satisfied that they could properly convict the accused on the basis of his consciousness of guilt, the jury had properly to reject or exclude the accuseds explanation for his premature departure from the hotel.

His Honour also ordered that the applicant be registered pursuant to s11 and Schedule 3 of the <em>Sex Offenders Registration Act </em>2004. The applicant has applied to this Court for leave to appeal against the convictions. Although the applicant was represented at his trial by counsel and although the Full Grounds upon which he seeks to rely were settled by counsel, as was the outline of submissions, the applicant appeared before us unrepresented and conducted the application in person. As I will mention later, although the applicants knowledge of the English language is limited, he is capable of being understood and, before us, he was assisted by an interpreter who was duly sworn. As will become apparent, the applicants oral argument before us was not confined to the Full Grounds or the outline of submissions. In fact, much of the oral submissions was not directed to the claims in those documents. Nevertheless, I shall deal with the substance of Mr Yusufs oral submissions as well as the contentions in the written outline.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Before considering these matters, however, it is necessary to describe briefly the relevant circumstances of the offending. At the time of the offending on 10 April 2001, the applicant was aged 38 years and the complainant, who had come to Australia from Vietnam with her parents, was aged approximately 20 years. They had not known each other prior to this incident. In the early afternoon of 10&nbsp;April 2001, each was waiting at the Footscray railway station to catch a train to Geelong. The complainant was travelling from her mothers home in Footscray to Geelong, where she was studying a designer course in clothing industries at the Gordon TAFE. The applicant had arrived in Melbourne approximately one week before this from the United Kingdom. He was a Cypriot by birth but had married an Irish woman and lived there for some years. As I have said, although his grasp of the English language is limited, he could nevertheless converse and make himself understood in that language. He had been staying with his aunt in Braybrook and, like the complainant, was returning to Geelong. Whilst waiting for the train, on the platform, the applicant sat next to the complainant and engaged her in conversation. In the train, they sat next to one another and continued to talk about matters of mutual interest. In response to the applicants enquiry, the complainant told him that she wanted to be a fashion designer. He effectively suggested that it would be advantageous for her to go to Europe and showed her his Irish passport. He said that he owned a restaurant in Geelong and that he used to be a sports teacher until he moved to Ireland.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;When they arrived in Geelong, they headed in the same direction, with the applicant carrying the complainants bags. It was the complainants intention to go to her boarding house. As they walked along, the applicant ascertained from the complainant that her boyfriend lived in Melbourne and he told her that he was married. He asked the complainant if she was too busy to have a cup of coffee with him and, because he seemed to her to be a nice person, she agreed. After frequenting a café they went to a restaurant where the applicant bought a bottle of wine "to celebrate their friendship". The complainant said that, although she had drunk alcohol in the past, she usually did not drink wine. At the restaurant they drank the bottle of wine with their meal, the applicant pouring the wine. When they left the restaurant, the complainant wanted to go home but the applicant suggested that they go to a pub called "Max". There he bought the complainant a drink in a cocktail glass while he had a glass of beer. He asked the complainant whether she would go to Europe if she had a chance and suggested that, if he obtained for her a passport and bought tickets to Europe, she could live with him. The complainant said that the applicant then asked her if she liked jewellery, and it was at about this time that she began to feel uncomfortable. It was the complainants evidence that, as they were leaving the pub, the applicant told her that he needed to get his cigarettes from his hotel, which was just around the corner, and it would only take a couple of minutes to get them and that he would then take her home in a taxi. She said that, at that time, she was tipsy. Be that as it may, they went together to the applicants room in his hotel, which was on the first floor. The complainant said that she stood by the door waiting for the applicant to get his cigarettes. He was shuffling around in his room and told her to come in. As she did so, he closed the door and the complainant believed that he locked it. The complainant said that she told him she wanted to go home and to take her to the taxi rank. The applicant sat on his bed and said that he was tired and wanted a nap for ten minutes, and that he would then take her home. He took off his jacket and lay on the bed. The complainant said that, although she stayed at the door for some time, she was frightened. Without threatening her, the applicant told the complainant to sit on the bed and she sat on the corner of it for a while. He then pulled her down and, although she struggled, he grabbed her by the arm. She claimed that she told him she just wanted to go home, that she had a boyfriend, and that she did not feel the same way about him. He then pulled off her top, although she tried to stop him. The complainant said that he started to kiss her and that she was crying and asked him to stop. She said that he took off his pants, pulled off her jeans, notwithstanding her struggle to resist, opened her legs and inserted his penis into her vagina (count 1.) She said that she was crying and begged him to stop, but he was "just doing what he wanted to do". The complainant said that he then pulled his penis out of her vagina and turned her over, holding on to her hips to keep her up. He inserted his penis into her vagina again. This was the subject of count 2 on the presentment. According to the complainant, the applicant told her she was a baby and to stop crying, and that she could have had everything. He said something like, "If you cant stop the rain, then you cant stop the way I feel about you." She then stood by the door for what seemed to be a long time, which she estimated to have been two hours. In the course of cross-examination, the complainant agreed that she had noticed a large amount of money in the applicants bag in the corner of the room that would have amounted to at least $2,000. When the applicant finally opened the door, the complainant ran down the stairs and out into the street and kept running until she hailed a taxi to go home. The applicant had given her two $20 notes from the money that was in his bag just before she left.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;On the following day the applicant prematurely left his Geelong hotel and travelled to Queensland and then to Europe. Approximately one year later he returned to Australia via Queensland, where he was apprehended by the police on 28 May 2002. He participated in a long record of interview with the police, in the course of which he agreed that he had intercourse with the complainant on the day in question but essentially contended that it was consensual. He claimed that they held hands and kissed before going to his hotel, and that it was after intercourse had occurred that things "changed". The complainant asked him for $2,000. He became upset at this because he believed that she was "sleeping with him for money". The applicant said that he did not remember locking the door, but that if he did, he did it for the sake of privacy. He said that in any event it was merely a "snib" lock which could easily have been un-snibbed. He told the police that it was only after they had slept together and he rejected the complainant’s request for $2,000 that she said she wanted to go home. He said that when she left the room he went with her to see if he could get her a taxi but she "walked away". He agreed that he had checked out of his hotel early but said that this was because he felt "uncomfortable" because she had demanded money and said that, if she did not get it, she would go to the police. He thought that she might carry out her threat and that she might return and demand more money.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;I turn first to Mr Yusufs oral submissions. It was apparent that he had given a good deal of consideration to the matters that he put to the Court. He presented his case respectfully and without taking up unnecessary time. Essentially, he contended that his conviction breaches what he said was Article 6 of the <em>International Human Rights Convention </em>because he did not obtain a fair hearing, given the circumstances to which he pointed, including the following. First, he said that he should not have been charged with the offence because the prosecuting authorities did not have evidence that established his guilt. He claimed that he was, in effect, "set up" by the authorities in respect of the alleged offence. In that context, Mr Yusuf referred to the photographs that were Exhibit A in the trial and pointed out that they do not show, as he claimed was the fact, that a police station could be seen through the window of his bedroom. He claimed that other photographs depicted the police station through that window but that the "police" did not want those photographs in evidence because they could be used to attack the complainants version of the events by making it apparent that, if she had been raped as she claimed, she could have made the complaint at the police station.[2] What Mr&nbsp;Yusuf put before us in relation to the photographs does not, in my view, amount to fresh evidence and does not otherwise warrant setting aside the verdicts on that basis. If his claim as to the photographs had any merit, it could have been raised below. In the circumstances, it is not a matter that calls for interference by this Court. The same may be said about the other criticisms that he now advances against the investigators.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Yusuf also referred to a number of inconsistencies in the complainants evidence as to what occurred in his hotel room. They included the complainants error in the claim that, after she entered the room, the applicant locked the door. It was plain on the photographs, he said, that there was no lock on the door. Mr Yusuf also pointed to the complainants admission that she saw a large amount of cash in his bag and that, contrary to her claim that it was dark outside his hotel at the relevant time, street lights illuminated the area. But to the extent that these and like matters to which Mr Yusuf referred went to the complainants credit and reliability, they were put to the jury by his counsel at his trial.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Yusuf also contended that his lawyers had not properly represented him. It seems that this is not the first time that the applicant has made such a claim. He terminated his counsels retainer at the conclusion of the trial and he did that again in respect of counsel who settled the Full Grounds and the outline of submissions. Be that as it may, I consider, as the trial judge did, that the applicant was competently represented by counsel at his trial and the same may be said about the terms of the Full Grounds and the outline of submissions. Thus, I consider that there is absolutely no basis for Mr Yusufs claim that his representation at trial was a factor that made the trial unfair.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;I now turn to consider the written outline of submissions that was filed on the applicants behalf. <br /><strong>Ground 1 - Failure to direct as to satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt about evidence and vital issues<br />9.</strong>&nbsp;Under cover of ground 1 it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour failed to make clear to the jury that mere preference for the complainants version of events was not sufficient to convict him of the offence in question. The jury should have been told that even if they preferred the evidence of the complainant, they could not convict the applicant unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her relevant evidence. It was also claimed that his Honour failed to direct the jury that even if they did not positively accept the applicants account on a critical issue, they could not find against him in relation to it if they had a reasonable doubt about it. Reference was made to a number of authorities[3] which, it was said, support the claim that the jury should have been charged as the applicant now contends. In <em>Liberato</em>, for example, Brennan and Deane JJ made it plain that, where the jury had to choose between a Crown witness and a witness for the defence, they should be told that the mere resolution of a conflict against the defence is not to be taken as concluding the issue, namely, whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the issue which it bears the onus of proving. The jury must be told that, even if they prefer the evidence of the prosecution, they should not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. The jury must also be told that even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence, they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue. And in <em>Crisafio</em>, Murray J said[4] that, in a case of this kind, where the evidence is entirely or substantially oath against oath:[5]<br />"It is imperative that the jury not be given any impression that in such a case the guilt of the accused will be established by the jurys preference for the evidence of the complainant. The matters discussed in Liberato are of critical importance and the jury must be properly instructed that if they are left unable to reject the evidence of the accused, although they do not positively accept it, they could not find guilt established beyond reasonable doubt, and even if the evidence of the accused is rejected attention must still be given to the important question whether the evidence of the complainant, or so much of it as the jury do accept, establishes the commission of the offence beyond reasonable doubt."<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;It was said, as I have noted, that the judge failed so to direct the jury. Moreover, it was claimed for the applicant that his Honour told the jury to the effect that, if there was uncertainty in their minds about the complainants evidence, "it is obviously more difficult for the Crown to get you to accept its version beyond reasonable doubt". Such a direction, it was inferentially claimed, was inconsistent with the need to emphasise to the jury that they must be positively satisfied about the truth of the complainants evidence before they could act on it. It was also said that the judge repeatedly equated the acceptance of the complainants evidence with proof of the Crown case.<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;I consider that the applicants complaint under this ground is without merit. It is trite that, in order to determine if his Honour erred as is alleged, the impugned passage must be considered in the context of the charge as a whole. Thus, it is relevant to note that, near the outset of the charge, his Honour gave the standard directions as to proof and onus of proof and no complaint is made about that. Importantly, for present purposes, his Honour then told the jury that mere preference for the complainants evidence or version of events is not sufficient, and that before they could find the applicant guilty they must be satisfied that the elements of the charge (which the judge later identified to the jury) had been made out beyond reasonable doubt. In this context, his Honour told the jury: "You have to be satisfied that what she said is truthful and reliable." The learned trial judge also directed the jury that they should put sympathy and prejudice to one side. This was apposite in this case. His Honours statement that it would be difficult for the jury to accept the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt if there was uncertainty in their minds as to an important issue was made in the context of the judges summary of the submissions of the applicants counsel to the effect that, given the way in which the complainant expressed herself in the course of the evidence, there must be uncertainty about what she was saying about the relevant events. Given the context, I consider that the judges impugned remark is unexceptional. I also consider that in his charge the judge did not equate the acceptance of the complainants evidence with the Crown case as alleged. Thus, although the learned trial judge did not use the words of Brennan J in <em>Liberato </em>and those suggested by Murray J in <em>Crisafio</em>, to which I have referred, the charge as a whole would have made those principles plain to the jury.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;I also note that no exception was taken to his Honours charge along the lines of ground 1. This indicates that the applicants experienced counsel did not consider that the judges charge contained the error or the injustice contended for under cover of this ground.[6] In the circumstances, as I have said, I think that this ground must fail.<br /><strong>Ground 2 - Failure to give adequate directions as to the applicants account in his record of interview<br />13.</strong>&nbsp;It was claimed for the applicant under ground 2 that the charge was unfair and unbalanced because the jury was not provided with an effective summary of the applicants version of the relevant events as described by him in his record of interview, and it was not explained to them how they could use that material in their deliberations. It was pointed out that this difficulty arose in a context where the judge had put the Crowns case to the jury "extensively by reading slabs of evidence". By way of contrast, it was claimed, very little was said about the defence case. In particular, it was claimed that, notwithstanding that the record of interview was 109 pages that contained 950 questions and answers, his Honour only provided the jury with a two-page summary of the record of interview. In support of the claim that the charge was so unbalanced, reference was made to what was said in that regard by Ormiston JA in <em>R v Crockett</em>.[7] That case was concerned with a charge that contained so many errors that this Court concluded that the conviction could not stand. In the course of illustrating the nature of the errors, Ormiston JA referred to the failure by the trial judge to put the applicants defence that was contained in his record of interview. His Honour noted[8] that most of the Crown case was recounted to the jury in "inordinate detail, largely by reading the transcript and no attempt was made to summarise the applicants version contained in the record of interview This was clearly unbalanced and manifestly unfair." His Honour acknowledged, however, that sometimes a failure to summarise evidence may be excused having regard to the context of the case. The trial in that case lasted for six sitting days.<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, however, the situation here bears no relevant resemblance to that in <em>Crockett</em>. First, the applicants trial lasted for only a little over one day and the evidence was essentially completed in an afternoon, including the playing of the tape of the record of interview. Plainly, the jury had the evidence fresh in their minds when they heard the charge and when they considered the matter. Secondly, his Honour did not recount the evidence to the jury in "inordinate detail" and he did not summarise it by reading the transcript extensively or otherwise. His Honour told the jury, on the morning of the second day of the trial, that he would remind them of some of the evidence for the purpose of stimulating their recollection of it by reading to them his notes of the evidence. And that is what his Honour did. That process took up five pages of the transcript of the charge. His Honour then effectively read to the jury his summary of the "lengthy record of interview". His Honour recounted to the jury the essentials of the applicants defence, namely, that he had done nothing wrong – if he had committed the offence, why would he come back to Australia, he said. The judge then proceeded to tell the jury, in summary form, what the applicant contended in his record of interview had occurred in his hotel room on the afternoon in question. Importantly, the summary of the applicants case emphasised that he believed that the sexual intercourse was consensual. It also referred to the circumstances that bore on this conclusion, such as the complainant’s enjoyment of his company, their holding of hands and kissing before they had intercourse and his total inability to understand why she alleged the offence unless it was because he refused to give her the $2,000 that she demanded. The summary took up to two pages of the transcript of the charge and plainly reflected the applicants case in defence. It is quite apparent that much of the record of interview would not have been so relevant. I consider that it must have been apparent to the jury how they could use the applicants version of events in their deliberations.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Importantly, there is no absolute rule as to what is required to be addressed by the judge in the charge to the jury in order to ensure a fair trial. As Eames JA said in <em>R v Zilm</em>,[9] what is required by way of directions "may vary according to the circumstances of the case" and factors such as the length of the case, the complexity of the issues and the manner in which the case is conducted by the parties will be relevant. Where the evidence is relatively short and the issues clearly drawn, as was the case here, a detailed account of the evidence may not be determinative.[10]<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;I consider that, in the circumstances, the impugned part of the charge was fair and balanced. I also note that no exception to the effect now pressed was taken to the charge at the trial. It follows that, in my view, ground 2 should fail.<br /><strong>Ground 3 - Unbalanced charge<br />17.</strong>&nbsp;It was alleged for the applicant under cover of ground 3 that the charge was unbalanced for yet another reason, namely, that it dealt with the issue of consent in a manner favourable to the Crown to the disadvantage of the applicant. It was pointed out that the prosecutions case was put extensively in the charge, whereas the applicants version was put only briefly and was qualified and described by the judge as "not conclusive".<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;It seems to me, however, that the bulk of the impugned charge, in so far as it dealt with the Crown case, was concerned with explaining to the jury the requirements of s37 of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 in accordance with Yusuf No.1, including the evidence that related to the matters identified in that provision. Thus, for example, the judge dealt with the need for the jury to consider whether the Crown had established that the complainant was not relevantly consenting. Plainly, this and like issues required careful analysis in the charge. This was obviously done by his Honour and no complaint is made in that regard. In this context, his Honour discussed the respective matters that could be taken into account by the jury as pointing for and against the contention that the complainant consented to sexual intercourse with the applicant. In those passages of his charge, his Honour also necessarily dealt with matters such as the applicants state of mind at the relevant time, whether he believed the complainant was or might not be consenting and whether his belief was reasonable. In my view, his Honours charge on this aspect of the case was balanced.<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;I refer for completeness to the claim that in his charge his Honour described the applicants case as being "not conclusive". This submission, however, shows a misunderstanding of what the judge said. Looking at the matter in context, it is apparent, I think, that his Honour was speaking, not of the applicants case, but about the factors that he was about to recount to the jury as possibly going to the question of the applicants belief, which, the judge said, were not exhaustive. His Honour said that those matters "are not conclusive, they are not exhaustive, but they are some of the factors that occur to me that may be relevant on this issue, of the way he may have viewed the situation". It is quite plain, therefore, I think, that his Honour did not tell the jury, as is claimed, that the applicants version of events was "not conclusive".<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Thus, I consider that the charge does not lack balance as is claimed in ground 3, so that it is not surprising that no exception along the lines contended for was taken at the trial by the applicants counsel.<br /><strong>Ground 4 - Error in consciousness of guilt direction<br />21.</strong>&nbsp;It was argued for the applicant under ground 4 that his Honour erred in his direction relating to the Crown case that the applicants premature flight demonstrated consciousness of guilt. More particularly, it was said that the judge did not tell the jury that, in order to convict the applicant on that basis, they had to be satisfied that he departed prematurely because of his consciousness of guilt of the crime and for no other reason and that, if they were in doubt as to his reason for leaving, they could not infer consciousness of guilt on his part. It was also claimed for the applicant that the judge wrongly told the jury that if they concluded that he decamped because of his realisation of guilt and wished to avoid apprehension, they "were more or less deciding the case against him" and that flight was strong evidence of, or was tantamount to, the applicants guilt. The applicant contended that a careful <em>Edwards</em>[11] direction should have been given by his Honour. It was also said that, in the circumstances of the charge, the judges comments concerning the applicants departure from his hotel were left as directions of law.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, however, a fair reading of the whole of the relevant part of his Honours charge makes it apparent that the deficiencies contended for have not been made out such as to vitiate the verdict. That the applicants experienced trial counsel took no objection to his Honours charge on that basis is some indication, I think, that he perceived no error or injustice in his Honours charge as is alleged. His Honour made it plain to the jury, I think, that in order for them properly to conclude that the applicants premature departure from the hotel demonstrated consciousness of guilt on his part they had to exclude or reject his alternative explanation for his departure.<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;At the outset of his charge on this issue, and then again later, his Honour told the jury that his directions on this matter were directions of law which, as the judge had earlier explained to the jury, were binding on them. When his Honour told the jury that if they accepted the Crown case that the applicant decamped in a prompt fashion because he knew that he had raped the complainant and wanted to avoid detection they would be "more or less deciding the case against him", the judge meant no more, as he went on to say, that such a conclusion would "amount to very strong evidence of guilt". And so it would, in my view. Importantly, his Honour also told the jury that, because such a course was virtually tantamount to guilt, they would have to be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour also emphasised that the jury should be aware that there could have been other reasons for the applicant leaving his hotel prematurely, as he claimed was the case. The judge proceeded to point out those "other reasons". His Honour concluded this aspect of the charge as follows:<br />"As I have said, for you to use this to convict you have to be able to exclude those other possibilities beyond reasonable doubt. And you have to accept beyond reasonable doubt that he left because he knew he had raped her and he wanted to avoid the consequences."<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;In the circumstances, although his Honour did not in terms follow the form of the Edwards direction, what he said in that regard, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, was sufficient to make the jury aware of the essential matters of which they had to be satisfied before they could properly convict the applicant on the basis of his consciousness of guilt.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In the circumstances, there is no need to consider ground 5. I would dismiss the application.<br /><strong>VINCENT JA: <br />26.</strong>&nbsp;I agree, and I do so for the reasons given by the learned presiding judge.<br /><strong>REDLICH JA:</strong><br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;I also agree.&nbsp;<br /><strong>CHERNOV JA: <br />28.</strong>&nbsp;The order of the Court is that the application is dismissed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] The applicant had previously been convicted of the same offences in the County Court at Geelong on 11 September 2003, but this conviction was quashed by this Court and a new trial ordered on 6 April 2005 – <em>R v Yusuf </em>(2005) 11 VR 492 ("Yusuf No.1").<br />[2] The relevant photograph in Exhibit A shows that a petrol station could be made out through the window in question.<br />[3] <em>Crisafio v The Queen </em>(2003) 141 A Crim R 98 at 112 per Murray J with whom Malcolm CJ and Parker J agreed; <em>Liberato v The Queen </em>(1985) 159 CLR 507 at 515 per Brennan J and 520-521 per Deane J; <em>Middleton v The Queen </em>(2000) 114 A Crim R 141 at 144-145 per Miller J with whom Kennedy ACJ and Wallwork J agreed; and <em>R v Niass </em>(2005) NSWCCA 120 at [28] per Hunt AJA with whom Grove and Hall JJ agreed.<br />[4] At 112.<br />[5] Here, the source of the different versions of the relevant events was confined to the evidence of the complainant and the applicants record of interview.<br />[6] See, for example, <em>R v Wright </em>[1999] 3 VR 355 at 356 per Phillips CJ and Charles JA and at 360-361 per Callaway JA.<br />[7] (2001) 124 A Crim R 312 at 314-315.<br />[8] At 314-315.<br />[9] [2006] VSCA 72 at [52].<br />[10] <em>R v Dao </em>(2005) 156 A Crim R 459 at 463-464 per Buchanan, Vincent, JJ A and Byrne, AJA.<br />[11] <em>Edwards v The Queen </em>(1993) 178 CLR 193.</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the Crown: Mr CW Beale, counsel.

H. agreed to rectify the error, however, he received an offer from NEP/L to buy the shares. Said to be in a confused state, H. signed the transfer form and sent it to NEP/L. When NEP/L requested that H. provide his shareholder registration number H. realised that he had made an error. He made efforts to contact NEP/L without success. Later, NEP/L took proceedings against H. claiming the value of the shares for breach of contract. At the hearing, evidence was given as to the circumstances surrounding H''s acquisition of the shares and as to his confused state. The magistrate found that H. had no title to the shares and that he had no intention to enter into a contract to sell the shares. Accordingly, the claim was dismissed. Upon appeal—<br />&nbsp;<br />HELD: Appeal dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>Should a person who signs and returns a transfer of shares form, which is an apparent act of acceptance, be able to get out of the apparent contract thus formed? It is likely rarely to be the case. However, in the present case, once H. explained his position, this could be seen to be such a rare case. The Magistrate was entitled to find that the facts were as claimed by H., and that there was no contract, because there was no title and no intention to contract. In those circumstances, the magistrate was not in error in dismissing the claim. </p>\r\n<p>TEAGUE J:<br />1.&nbsp;These are my reasons for concluding that I should dismiss an appeal from an order of a Master dismissing a proceeding taken by way of an appeal from an order of a Magistrate dismissing a complaint brought by the appellant. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;On 3 October 2003, a complaint was filed in the Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne. The Plaintiff was National Exchange Pty Ltd (“the appellant”) and the Defendant was Clive Gerard Hodder. I will refer to him at times by his full name to distinguish him from his father, Clive Maxwell Hodder, but otherwise generally as “Mr Hodder”. The appellant, by a complaint lodged in the Magistrates’ Court, claimed from Mr Hodder $2,171.19 for breach of contract. On 4 October 2004, following a hearing by way of arbitration before Magistrate Smith, the Magistrate made an order dismissing the complaint. On 3 November 2004, the appellant brought the proceeding in this court appealing against the order of the Magistrate. On 17 December 2004, Master Wheeler dismissed the proceeding. In the formal Court record, there is stated under “Other Matters”: “I accept that the Magistrate did not in terms hold that exhibit “DT-15” was attached to “DT7”however it was open to the Magistrate on the evidence to dismiss the proceeding. Therefore, I find there is no question of law to be decided.” On 22 December 2004, the appellant filed its notice of appeal against that order. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Order 77 of the Supreme Court Rules provides that an appeal from an order of a Master shall be by re-hearing de novo of the application to the Master. Part 3 of Order 58 of the Supreme Court Rules contains the provisions governing the process for dealing with an appeal from the Magistrates’ Court under s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. On 1 October 2004, a new Part 3 was substituted. Rule 58.10(8) provides: <br />“The Master may dismiss the appeal if satisfied that—<br />(a) the notice of appeal does not identify sufficiently or at all a question of law on which the appeal may be brought;<br />(b) the appellant does not have an arguable case on appeal or to refuse leave would impose no substantial injustice; or<br />(c) the appeal is frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.”</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;Before me, Mr Waller for the appellant submitted that the Master and Magistrate had erred. Mr Hurley for Mr Hodder submitted that neither had erred and that the appeal should be dismissed. It is necessary to outline both the events which gave rise to the proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court and the course of those proceedings. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;As to the appellant, the only substantial focus was on two forms. One form was a transfer form signed by Mr Hodder on 14 February 2003, and sent to the appellant on or about that day. The other was the letter dated 10 February 2003 addressed to Mr Hodder in which the unsigned transfer form was enclosed, and which indicated the terms on which the appellant offered to buy the 796 shares in IAG which, according to IAG’s register of members, Mr Hodder owned. The appellant’s position was that Mr Hodder had, by signing and returning the transfer form, accepted its offer, that there was a contract for the sale and purchase of the shares, and that the appellant was entitled to judgment for damages for the breach of that contract. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;As to the other side of the story, I have essentially summarised the evidence given by or for Mr Hodder before the Magistrate. Clive Gerard Hodder is one of three sons of Clive Maxwell Hodder, to whom I will generally refer after this as “the deceased”. The Hodders live in New South Wales. Both Clive Maxwell Hodder and Clive Gerard Hodder had shares in NRMA Insurance Ltd, which had its origins in the National Roads and Motorists’ Association, which has a significant presence in New South Wales. At the time that NRMA Insurance Ltd demutualised in 2000, Clive Gerard Hodder sold his shares. The deceased did not sell his shares, and received shares in NRMA Insurance Group Limited. That company later changed its name to Insurance Australia Group Ltd (“IAG”). In November 2001, the deceased died. Under his 1988 will, his wife (“Eileen Hodder”) and three sons were executors and trustees, his wife had a life interest and the three sons were the remaindermen. A form was prepared to transfer the deceased’s shares in IAG. The plan was to have the shares transferred into the name of Eileen Hodder. By mistake, the shares were transferred into the name of Clive Gerard Hodder. Eileen Hodder learned of this mistake. She asked that the shares be transferred into her name. Her son, Clive Gerard Hodder, agreed that this was appropriate. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;Some time after he had so agreed, Mr Hodder received the letter of 10 February 2003 from the appellant. He expressed himself as then being confused, and in that confused state, having erred in thinking that the form related to the planned transfer of the shares into the name of his mother, he had signed the transfer form and had sent it off. When he received the follow up letter from the appellant, asking him to provide his Shareholder Registration Number (“SRN”), he realised that he had erred. He set out to explain to the appellant how the error had been made. That proved to be a difficult exercise, even though the appellants letter bore an address and a telephone number. Mr Hodder enlisted the help of his partner, Lorraine Ratcliffe, to make it known to the appellant that there had been a mistake. She telephoned the number given in the letter from the appellant. She got only a recorded message. She then typed up a letter from Mr Hodder to the appellant. She sent it by fax to the appellant. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;At the hearing before the Magistrate, evidence on behalf of the appellant was given by Mr David Tweed, a director of National Exchange Pty Ltd. He was asked whether the appellant had received the letter which Ms Ratcliffe had faxed. Mr Tweed said first that he had never seen the letter, that it was not on the file, that it was not relevant because the appellant had already purchased the shares and that the letter may have been put in the bin. He modified that a little later to say that he may have received it, and he may have thought it not relevant as the share had already been purchased, and he would have put it in the bin. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;At the hearing before the Magistrate, the appellant was represented by a lawyer, Mr Griffin. Mr Hodder was not represented. The hearing took the form of an arbitration under s102 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. This had implications, including as to discovery, pleadings, and the rules of evidence, that were adverted to more than once by the Magistrate. Under s103 of that Act, the Magistrate is bound by the rules of natural justice, but not by rules of evidence. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;A taped record was made of what was said at the hearing. An affidavit was sworn by David Tweed and filed in this court. To that affidavit, was exhibited a copy of a transcript, referred to as a copy of a transcript made of the hearing on 4 October 2004. This is one of four occasions within the last year that I have encountered a practice as to such a transcript that I find troubling. It is of producing a transcript made from a tape of what was recorded, but without any indication whether a person present at the time the recording was made has checked the accuracy of the transcript, or otherwise sought to have it revised, whether by the magistrate or otherwise. Even more troubling to me is that there is no indication whether the magistrate has been asked for a written statement of reasons to clarify the short final summation that he made. It seems that the assumption has been made that a later reviewer of the transcript can and should be left to interpret the transcript doing the best that he or she can. At times, there can be a need to interpret matters transcribed in a way that is not clear. The problem is amplified in a situation such as occurred here. On my reading of the transcript, the Magistrate did not give detailed oral reasons, but merely a short final summation consequent upon a lengthy hearing of submissions, in which the Magistrate took a very active part. Hence, in reviewing the transcript including the final summation, one object of the review must necessarily be to assess whether a preliminary position stated by the Magistrate is appropriately to be taken as forming part of the final reasoning. In any such situation, the disposition of a reviewer is likely to be to interpret what has been said in earlier discussion in a way that is consistent with the final conclusion and summation, unless the contrary is apparent. The result of that approach may be that it is likely to be more difficult to satisfy the reviewer of error where the claimed error may be seen to be in a proposition which is inconsistent with the conclusion. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;I have noted that there were no formally delivered oral reasons, but what I would refer to as a final summation, in an exchange in these terms:<br />&nbsp;<br />Mr Griffin: “You’re led to believe Your Honour that four trustees made a mistake, mother, two brothers and this person. It’s in Your Honour’s hands.”</p>\r\n<p>His Honour: “It is part of the father’s estate, there’s no doubt about that, that’s not put in issue therefore it’s covered by the will is it not and the will makes it absolutely clear what should happen to all of the estate except for an occasion where there was a resolution by all the trustees to advance part of the estate to a potential beneficiary or a named beneficiary in the will. And that’s the evidence both of the witness the defendant and the mother whom both of them are trustees. Therefore regardless of how it came to stand otherwise by way of mistake, negligence or silliness or even greed, in the name of a single trustee on a share registry it seems to me that the balance of the evidence is that this particular defendant at the time he signed that share transfer did not have either the legal or beneficial interest in these shares. Therefore he could not have sold them to National Exchange. He had nothing to sell.”</p>\r\n<p>Mr Griffin: “If that’s Your Honour’s determination.”</p>\r\n<p>His Honour: “Yes. Right the claim will be dismissed thank you.”</p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;That summation had followed a lively exchange of positions between the Magistrate and Mr Griffin. The exchange consisted partly of submissions by Mr Griffin, partly of the stating of preliminary positions by the Magistrate, and partly of questions and answers between the two. In the circumstance of this case, Mr Hodder could have been expected to contribute little, and that was what happened. The exchange was the sort of exchange not infrequently encountered in the Practice Court in this court. Mostly, that kind of process produces, and can be seen to produce, a more satisfying result than one where the judicial officer simply listens without comment. However, there is the added difficulty when reviewing that process that such an exchange must be subjected to a close scrutiny in order to assess whether preliminary positions can appropriately be seen as forming part of the final reasoning of the decision-maker. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;What was said at the end can only be seen in the context of all that went before. So one must return to the start. When the hearing started, there was a preliminary discussion involving the Magistrate, Mr Griffin and Mr Hodder. In the course of that discussion, a number of matters were said which, on my review of what was said, pointed clearly to Mr Hodder being a person prone to being disorganised, vague and readily confused. A number of events and statements later in the hearing only served to confirm that assessment. There was also apparent, a significant level of dependency of Mr Hodder upon his partner, Lorraine Ratcliffe. She was with him during the hearing, and ultimately gave evidence on his call. After the preliminary discussion, oral testimony was given of behalf of the appellant by Mr Tweed. There was then further discussion, before oral testimony was given by each of Mr Hodder and Ms Ratcliffe. There was then the lengthy exchange between the Magistrate and Mr Griffin, which ultimately led to the passage that I have set out above. In the course of that discussion, the matter was stood down, while steps were taken to obtain a copy of the will of the deceased. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;There were a significant number of documents before the Magistrate. They included a copy of the will of the deceased, a statutory declaration of Eileen Hodder, the letter and transfer form sent to, and signed and returned by Mr Hodder, and copies of later letters. Some objections were taken by Mr Griffin to the Magistrate receiving some documents. There was not a formal ruling as to any objection. There were matters said by the Magistrate that warranted my inferring that the objections were not sustained for reasons that included that the hearing was proceeding by way of arbitration according to the provisions referred to above. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Mr Griffin raised the issue of an alternative basis or bases upon which the appellant might succeed if the Magistrate found that Mr Hodder had any one of: no capacity to contract to sell the IAG shares; no title to the share; or, no intention to sell the shares. The alternative basis or bases were not precisely articulated at any stage. There was reference at times to “misrepresentation” and to “breach of warranty of authority” and to other possible heads. When those alternative bases were discussed, not only was there a lack of precision in articulation, there was also a query by the Magistrate as to whether it was too late to raise such an alternative. That would have been a particular concern given that Mr Hodder was not legally represented. There were other significant obstacles to any alternative claim. One lay in the promptness in the claimed communicating by or on behalf of Mr Hodder to the appellant of the nature of Mr Hodder’s error as to his not being the owner of the shares. Mr Waller, before me, argued that comments made by the Magistrate pointed to his not having found that there was such communications as claimed. On my review of what was said by the Magistrate, I was much more disposed to infer that he had found, although he had not expressly said so, that there had been the communications as claimed. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;I have noted above that there were a number of indications of the relative vagueness of Mr Hodder, and of his apparent strong dependency upon Ms Ratcliffe. He also indicated that he also has poor sight. On the other hand, he has a university degree, and is a music and science teacher. The transcript reveals that there were many issues raised by Mr Griffin with the Magistrate as to the credibility of the evidence given by Mr Hodder. Mr Griffin argued that there were many aspects of his account that were scarcely credible. They included: that there had been unsatisfactorily explained reasons why the shares in his father’s estate had been transferred into the name of Mr Hodder; that at one time he had stated that his and his father’s name were identical whereas the true position was that they were only substantially similar; that at one time he had said that his mother inherited all of his father’s estate, whereas the true position was that she got a life interest; that there had been a long delay between the time of his mother telling him to have the share ownership changed over to her and the time of the receipt of the appellant’s letter; that he had been in a state of confusion when he signed and sent back the form with the appellant’s letter; and, that he had acted promptly in getting Ms Ratcliffe to try to communicate with the appellant by telephone and fax. The inference that I would draw from reading all of the transcript is that, while the Magistrate did have reservations about the respondent for the reasons advanced by Mr Griffin, the Magistrate nonetheless accepted the substance of the evidence of the respondent. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Mr Waller submitted to me that each of the Magistrate and the Master had erred. He put to me that, insofar as the Magistrate had made comments that could be interpreted as his having found that Mr Hodder had nothing to sell, and that he had made a mistake in signing and returning the appellant’s form, such findings were contrary to the evidence. Further, he put to me that the magistrate had made an error in law in that he had treated the mistake of Mr Hodder as entitling the latter to withdraw from a binding contract. He took me to passages in Macrae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission (1951) 84 CLR 377 and Taylor v Johnson (1982-3) 151 CLR 422 as support for the proposition that&nbsp; such a mistake cannot be so relied on. He put to me that the Magistrate made comments that should be interpreted as reflecting his having found that the fax which Mr Hodder claimed to have had sent to the appellant was not sent. He referred critically to two alternative submissions advanced by Mr Hurley. One of the two submissions was based on the decision of Osborn J in National Exchange Pty Ltd v Vane [2003] VSC 361. There it was decided, put shortly, that a Magistrate faced with a comparable situation could find otherwise than that the offer to buy shares had been accepted. The other submission was that the appeal from the Magistrate was properly dismissed as frivolous or vexatious. Mr Waller argued that National Exchange Pty Ltd v Vane was distinguishable, having regard to what he claimed was a fundamental difference in the way that the offer to buy shares was framed. He argued that this could not be treated as a frivolous or vexatious case. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;There is a fundamental problem underlying the principal submissions. It stems from the quite different assessment of the reasons of the Magistrate argued for by Mr Waller, than that made by me after reviewing the whole of the transcript. In my assessment, the Magistrate can be treated as having made findings of fact that Mr Hodder had no title to the IAG shares, and that Mr Hodder had no intention to enter into a contract to sell the shares. There was no mistake of the kind which might attract the application of the proposition laid down in Macrae. The Magistrate having made those findings, there was not identified a question of law on which the appeal may be brought. For the same reason, the appellant does not have an arguable case on appeal. As no alternative claim had been made, or at least satisfactorily made, to the Magistrate, it did not have to be addressed. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;It is not necessary to address the possible applicability of either the argument based on the propositions articulated in National Exchange Pty Ltd v Vane, or the argument as to the appeal being frivolous. I would simply note that, as to the first, I would not have been disposed to treat the change in the wording of the offer as fundamental. It may have made a material difference, but I have my reservations. That there was a need for Mr Hodder to provide his SRN before the appellant could become registered is apparent from the further letters sent by the appellant. As to the second, I would not have been disposed to treat the appeal as frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court. On the one hand, the amount claimed was relatively small. It had been boosted by an increase in the value of the shares after February 2003. There also was, or appeared to be, a relative disproportion as between the disorganised and unrepresented Mr Hodder and the organised and represented corporate appellant. On the other hand, until Mr Hodder told his story, there could have been seen to be a principle at stake. Should a person who signs and returns a transfer of shares form, which is an apparent act of acceptance, be able to get out of the apparent contract thus formed? It is likely rarely to be the case. But once Mr Hodder explained his position, this could be seen to be such a rare case. The Magistrate was entitled to find that the facts were as claimed by Mr Hodder, and that there was no contract, because there was no title and no intention to contract. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;The appeal should be dismissed with the appellant to pay the costs of the respondent to be taxed if not agreed.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the Appellant National Exchange Pty Ltd: Mr IG Waller, counsel.

The <em>prima facie </em>rule of cumulation which s16(3B) creates is capable of being displaced should the court so direct on the ground of exceptional circumstances.<br />2.&nbsp;Where it was submitted that an accused person had proceeded to "get his life in order" when released on parole, and that he had provided clean urine screens when in custody, none of those matters constituted "exceptional circumstances" which displaced the cumulation rule provided by s16(3B) of the Act.<br />3.&nbsp;The principle of totality requires the sentencing court to take into account periods of cancelled parole being served. That is, a period of imprisonment being served at the time of the sentencing must be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. When viewed as a whole, the aggregate of sentences imposed by reason of cumulation cannot be greater than any sentence required to fulfil the totality principle and all the appropriate aims of sentencing in the case. There must be relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences, not only for the offences which the person is being sentenced, but for the sentence which the person is currently serving. <br />4.&nbsp;Accordingly, where a sentencer disregarded the fact that the accused was serving the unexpired portion of his original sentence when he came to be sentenced, the sentencing discretion miscarried.<br /><br />MAXWELL P, BUCHANAN and REDLICH JJ A:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;On 30 March 2005 the appellant ("Hunter") pleaded guilty to each count on a presentment containing a count of theft (count 1), kidnapping (count 2), false imprisonment (count 3), causing injury intentionally (count 4) and trafficking in a drug of dependence (count 5). On 27 April 2005 Hunter was sentenced on count 1 to six months’ imprisonment, on count 2 to four years’ imprisonment, on count 3 to two years and six months’ imprisonment, on count 4 to twelve months’ imprisonment and on count 5 to six months’ imprisonment.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The sentencing judge ordered that 18 months of the sentence imposed on count 3 and six months of the sentence imposed on count 4 be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on count 2 and that the sentences imposed on count 1 and count 5 be served cumulatively with the sentence imposed on count 2, and upon each other, making a total effective sentence of six years and six months. His Honour fixed a minimum term of four years and six months to be served before Hunter would become eligible for parole. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Hunter appeals, by leave, against his sentence. The grounds of appeal all relate to the alleged failure of the sentencing judge to take properly into account a sentence which Hunter was serving as a result of the cancellation of his parole.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The grounds are as follows:<br />"1. The learned sentencing judge’s discretion was vitiated by proceeding from the premise that a term of imprisonment for an offence committed whilst on parole must be served cumulatively on the parole sentence, without regard to the existence of exceptional circumstances.<br />2. The learned sentencing judge erred in treating the parole sentence as a potential liability contingent on what the parole board may or might not do, rather than an actual liability that was extant. <br />3. By ignoring the parole sentence the sentencing discretion has miscarried, offending the principle of totality."<br /><strong>Sentencing for offences committed while on parole<br />5.</strong>&nbsp;Each of the offences was committed while Hunter was on parole in relation to other offences. At the time of the sentencing, his parole had been cancelled by the Parole Board and he was serving the unexpired portion of his original sentence.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;He still had approximately two years and six months to serve. (The details of his parole history are set out later in these reasons).<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The grounds of appeal raise, not for the first time, important questions about the approach to be adopted by a sentencing court when dealing with an offender for offences committed while on parole for other offences. A related issue concerns the powers of the Parole Board when dealing with an offender for the breach of parole constituted by the commission of the later offences.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;We deal first with the powers of the Parole Board. The key provisions are to be found in Part 8 of the <em>Corrections Act </em>1986. In particular:<br />• following the expiry of the non-parole period, the Parole Board may order the release of the prisoner on parole: s74(1);<br />• following the prisoner’s release on parole, the Board has a general power to cancel the parole at any time before the end of the parole period: s77(1);<br />• if a prisoner is sentenced to more than three months’ imprisonment for an offence committed while on parole, the Board may cancel the prisoner’s parole even though the parole period may already have elapsed: s77(5);<br />• if the parole is cancelled, then, unless the Board otherwise directs, the time spent on parole is not to be regarded as time served in respect of the original sentence: s77(7)(b).<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Unless by the time of the sentencing hearing the Parole Board has already dealt with the breach of parole, the sentencing court will know only that the Board may exercise its power to cancel the parole. The sentencing judge is prohibited, by s5(2AA)(a) of the <em>Sentencing Act</em>, from taking into account any action which the Parole Board may take in the exercise of that power. In the language of the provision, the court must not have regard to –<br />"any possibility or likelihood that the length of time actually spent in custody by the offender will be affected by executive action of any kind".[1]<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Subsection 16(3B) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>deals with a different topic, namely, the relationship between the sentence to be imposed for the later offences and any period of imprisonment which the person may be required to serve upon cancellation of his/her parole. The requirement imposed by s16(3B) is perfectly clear. It is that the sentence for the later offences must –<br />"unless otherwise directed by the Court because of the existence of exceptional circumstances, be served cumulatively on any period of imprisonment which [the person] may be required to serve in custody in a prison on cancellation of the parole order."<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;As this Court explained in <em>R v Orphanides</em>,[2] s16(3B) was intended simply to abrogate, in the case of an offence committed during a period of parole, the general rule otherwise applying by virtue of s16(1), that sentences are to be served concurrently. The prima facie rule of cumulation which s16(3B) creates is capable of being displaced should the court so direct on the ground of exceptional circumstances.[3]<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;As the Court also explained in <em>Orphanides</em>, the prohibition on speculation which s5(2AA) imposes, and the cumulation rule which s16(3B) establishes, operate independently of each other. The phrase "may be required to serve" in s16(3B) does not permit, let alone require, the court to speculate about what the Parole Board might do. The prohibition on speculation is absolute. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;To comply with s16(3B), the sentencing court must first consider whether exceptional circumstances exist. If such circumstances do exist, the court has power to order concurrency, in whole or part; if it does not, the court is bound to order that the parole sentence be served cumulatively on any period of imprisonment which may flow from the cancellation of the parole order.<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In a case like the present, where the parole has already been cancelled and the offender is at the time of sentencing already serving a period of imprisonment consequent upon the cancellation, questions of totality also arise. We deal with those below.<br /><strong>Hunter’s parole history<br />15.</strong>&nbsp;In the course of the hearing, the Court raised questions concerning the orders made by the Parole Board. Subsequently, the Office of Public Prosecutions provided the Court with a letter from the Parole Board answering those questions and containing Hunter’s latest indent report. What follows is based on that information.<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;In 1988 Hunter was sentenced to 16 years’ imprisonment for murder ("the original sentence"). A non-parole period of 13 years was fixed. On 9 December 2000, Hunter was released on parole, after serving the minimum sentence of 13 years. His parole period was uneventful until 12 March 2002 when he committed the first of the offences the subject of the present appeal. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;On 13 March 2002, his parole was cancelled by the Parole Board.[4] As noted earlier, the period during which Hunter was on parole between 2000 and 2002 is not treated as time served in respect of the original sentence.[5] On 22 May 2002, Hunter was apprehended on warrant and, on the following day, his parole was cancelled. According to his indent, the amount of the original sentence "owing" at that time was two years 11 months and 29 days. On 8 July 2002 Hunter was re-paroled by the Parole Board.<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The charges the subject of this appeal were laid on 7 August 2003. Following Hunter’s failure to appear at his committal on 13 September 2004, his parole was again cancelled by the Parole Board on 22 September 2004, Hunter having failed to comply with the conditions of his parole. The indent records Hunter as then owing the Board two years 10 months and 11 days of the original sentence. On 18 October 2004 Hunter was apprehended on a parole warrant and recommenced serving the balance of the original sentence.<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;On 3 February 2005 he was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for driving offences. He appealed to the County Court against that sentence. The appeal was heard on 27 April 2005, and was allowed. Hunter was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment and it was ordered that the sentence be cumulative upon the sentences the subject of the present appeal, which were imposed the same day.<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Forty-eight days of the original sentence were served between 22 May 2002 and 28 July 2002. A further 113 days were served between 14 October 2004 and 3 February 2005 (when Hunter was sentenced for his driving offences). This meant that, at the time Hunter came to be sentenced on 27 April 2005, he had served 161 days of the parole period of the original sentence and he was liable to serve a further two years, six months and 20 days of that sentence.<br /><strong>Ground 1<br />21.</strong>&nbsp;In his sentencing remarks, the learned Judge noted that the offences for which Hunter was to be sentenced had been committed while he was on parole. There was no reference, however, to the fact that Hunter was in prison and serving the unexpired portion of his original sentence, with two and a half years to serve.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;It is clear from the transcript of argument on the plea that his Honour was alive to the prohibition created by s5(2AA) against taking into account "any possibility or likelihood" of action by the Parole Board. His Honour did not, however, give any consideration to the requirements of s16(3B). As we have said, that subsection required his Honour to consider whether exceptional circumstances existed which would justify moderating the order for cumulation which would otherwise have to be made. Because of this error, the sentencing discretion is reopened and it is necessary for this Court to decide whether there were any exceptional circumstances.<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Hunter relied upon three circumstances which were said to be exceptional. First, he relied on the delay of 15 months in charging him with these offences. Hunter had been interviewed on 22 May 2002 and had made extensive admissions in relation to these offences. It was submitted that, in the period from his re-parole on 8 July 2002 until he was charged with these offences on 7 August 2003, he had proceeded to "get his life in order". Such a submission was not made to the trial Judge and no evidence was placed before him, or before this Court, of any efforts by Hunter to rehabilitate himself during that period. Counsel for Hunter on the plea had said no more than that delay was a mitigating factor.<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, it was submitted that Hunter’s prospects of rehabilitation constituted an exceptional circumstance. It was acknowledged before this Court that, because of Hunter’s amphetamine use, he was in a florid state at the time of the commission of these offences. Initially, some reliance was placed upon the fact that Hunter had provided clean urine screens when in custody, but it was acknowledged in argument that this occurred prior to his arrest on the present charges. Ultimately, counsel for Hunter accepted that there was little or no material relating to Hunter’s conduct during his period on parole which threw any light upon his prospects of rehabilitation, and this argument was all but abandoned. Thirdly, counsel for Hunter referred to the principle of totality. He conceded – properly – that this could not constitute an exceptional circumstance under s16(3B), but argued that it was relevant to whether the sentencing discretion had miscarried.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In our view, none of these matters constitute "exceptional circumstances" which displace the cumulation rule provided by s16(3B).<br /><strong>Grounds 2 and 3<br />26.</strong>&nbsp;It is convenient to consider grounds 2 and 3 together. Counsel for Hunter submitted that the competing imperatives of s5(2AA) and s16(3B) create a difficulty for sentencing judges in applying the totality principle. As to ground 2, it was submitted that the trial Judge had either not understood that Hunter was serving the unexpired portion of his original sentence, as a consequence of the Parole Board’s cancellation of his parole, or else had misconstrued s5(2AA) of the Act as preventing him from having any regard to the sentence which Hunter was then serving as a consequence of the cancellation of his parole.<br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Under ground 3, it was contended for Hunter that the sentencing discretion miscarried because the judge ignored the fact that the balance of the original sentence was being served, and so failed to give effect to the principle of totality. It was submitted that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the total criminality of Hunter and, in particular, had not considered the whole of the jail time which Hunter would have to serve as a result of the cumulation required by s16(3B). <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;At first senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the principle of totality did not require the sentencing judge to take account of the original sentence being served. Some days after the conclusion of oral argument, however, a written submission was filed by the Director, which acknowledged that the principle of totality did require the sentencing judge to take into account periods of imprisonment consequent upon cancelled parole. In the written submission senior counsel referred to the decisions in <em>R v Masterson</em>[6]; <em>R v Youil</em>[7]; <em>R v Cutajar</em>[8]; <em>R v Brock</em>[9]; <em>R v Gorman</em>[10]; <em>R v Ulla</em>[11]; and <em>R v Berkelaar</em>[12] as illustrating that the principle of totality requires the sentencing court to take into account periods of cancelled parole being served.<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;This concession – belatedly made by the Crown – is clearly correct. This Court has made clear repeatedly that a period of imprisonment being served at the time of sentencing must be taken into account in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.[13] Nothing in s5(2AA) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>authorised, let alone required, the trial Judge to disregard the fact that Hunter was then serving the unexpired portion of his original sentence. On the contrary, the prohibition on speculation meant that the judge was bound to assume that the full term of the original sentence would be served. Any possibility that Hunter might again be released on parole had to be disregarded.<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;As already discussed, there must in the absence of exceptional circumstances be cumulation in respect of offences committed whilst on parole.[14] At the same time, viewed as a whole the aggregate of sentences imposed by reason of cumulation cannot be greater than any sentence required to fulfil the totality principle and all the appropriate aims of sentencing in the case.[15] There must be relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of sentences,[16] not only for the offences for which the person is being sentenced, but for the sentence which the person is currently serving.[17]<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;Where parole is cancelled, the principle of totality must "bulk large" in the determination of the aggregate term of imprisonment imposed for the later offences.[18] In <em>R v Sullivan</em>,[19] Eames, JA (with whom Charles and Buchanan JJ A agreed), said:<br />"[T]he principle of totality ... requires that the sentencing court evaluate the overall criminality involved in all the offences and adjust the sentence downwards, where appropriate, to ensure there is an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the length of sentence imposed. It is a principle which requires the court to have regard both to the sentences about to be imposed and those which the prisoner is undergoing: see <em>Postiglione v The Queen </em>(1997) 189 CLR 295. Notwithstanding section 16(3B), the principle of totality also has application in circumstances where, as here, the sentence currently being served derives from a breach of parole."[20]<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Because of the error to which we have referred, the sentencing discretion is reopened. It is necessary, therefore, to describe in brief terms the circumstances of each of the offences for which Hunter falls to be re-sentenced.<br /><strong>Count 1 – theft of a motor car<br />33.</strong>&nbsp;In early 2002, Hunter rented a sports car from a car rental firm. Following the expiration of the rental period, Hunter kept the vehicle and ultimately gave it to a friend, who sold the vehicle and paid him $2,500 from the sale proceeds. Hunter told investigating police that he committed the theft because he was desperate for money at the time. The vehicle has not been recovered. <br /><strong>Counts 2, 3 and 4 – kidnapping, false imprisonment and causing injury intentionally<br />34.</strong>&nbsp;In March 2002, Samantha Smith, who was a friend of Hunter’s, requested that he find and capture an acquaintance, one Scott McCasker. Smith promised Hunter $500 if he would do so. Hunter enlisted the assistance of his trans-sexual partner, Kelly Piers. On the morning of 12 March 2002, Hunter and Piers located McCasker in St&nbsp;Kilda and forced him into their vehicle. They then drove McCasker to Hunter’s premises in Armadale, where he was taken inside. Later, they drove McCasker to Smith’s address in Diggers Rest but she was not at home. Hunter then took McCasker back to Armadale, where McCasker was tied up and gagged. He was secured with tape and electric cord. His head was tied to a beam with a wire coat-hanger. Whilst McCasker was in that position, Hunter punched him to the face and ribs on a number of occasions, and he suffered injuries to the face and head. McCasker was left tied up in this way until he was able to free himself and escape from Hunter’s premises.<br /><strong>Count 5 – trafficking in a drug of dependence<br />35.</strong>&nbsp;On 22 May 2002 Hunter was arrested in relation to the offences committed in March 2002 to which we have referred. When he was searched, police located a number of half gram bags of amphetamine on Hunter’s person. He told police that he had used and sold amphetamines to pay for his board and rent. Other similar bags were located at Hunter’s premises. He explained to the police how he cut the amphetamine with glucose and bagged it in preparation for sale. He informed the police that he wanted to make money and leave Victoria to avoid warrants which he believed had been issued for his apprehension. He also stated that he had purchased a quarter of an ounce per week prior to his arrest and bagged about 20 "small lots". He admitted having sold ten small bags for $100 each before being arrested.<br /><strong>Relevant personal matters<br />36.</strong>&nbsp; Hunter is now aged 40. He came from an unsettled family background which was rendered stressful by his father’s aggression. By the time he was 18 he had been convicted of a number of offences, including burglary and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. As already noted he was convicted on one count of murder in 1988 and sentenced to 16 years’ imprisonment. Following his release on parole he worked in various hotels and restaurants. It appears that in mid-2001 he commenced using amphetamines. The reports tendered on the plea suggest that the offences the subject of this appeal were committed whilst the appellant was under the effects of substantial amphetamine abuse and in the context of a confused interest in trans-sexuals which had developed during his period in custody. Although arrested for these offences in May 2002, he was not charged until August 2003. He cooperated with investigating officers, made significant admissions and subsequently pleaded guilty to these offences. These are all matters that must be taken into account, as they were by the sentencing Judge.<br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;We propose to vary the sentences imposed by the trial Judge in the following manner. We sentence Hunter on count 2 to three years and nine months’ imprisonment and on count 3 to two years and three months’ imprisonment. We would not otherwise vary the terms of imprisonment imposed by the learned trial Judge. We make the same orders for concurrency and cumulation, making a total effective sentence of six years. We fix a minimum term of four years to be served before Hunter would become eligible for parole.<br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;The order of the Court will be:<br />1.&nbsp;The appeal against sentence imposed on 27 April 2005 is allowed in part.<br />2.&nbsp;The sentence on count 2 is quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to three years and nine months’ imprisonment.<br />3.&nbsp;The sentence on count 3 is quashed and in lieu thereof the appellant is sentenced to two years and three months’ imprisonment.<br />4.&nbsp;The sentences imposed on counts 1, 4 and 5 are affirmed, they being respectively six months’ imprisonment on count 1, 12 months’ imprisonment on count 4 and six months’ imprisonment on count 5, with six months of the sentence imposed on count 4 to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on count 2, and the sentence imposed on count 5 to be served cumulatively with the sentences imposed on counts 1 and 2.<br />5.&nbsp;The orders for concurrency and cumulation are affirmed, making a new total effective sentence of six years’ imprisonment.<br />6.&nbsp;A new non-parole period of four years is fixed.<br />7.&nbsp;It is declared that the period of 420 days pre-sentence detention has already been served under the sentence and it is ordered that the fact that this declaration was made and its details be noted in the records of the Court.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See <em>R v Kuru </em>(1995) 78 A Crim R 447 at 451; <em>R v Ponton </em>[2001] VSCA 36; <em>R v Orphanides</em> (2002) 130 A&nbsp; Crim R 403 at [33], [36].<br />[2] (2002) 130 A Crim R.<br />[3] <em>R. v Orphanides </em>(2002) 130 A Crim R 403 at 410 [25] per Phillips JA.<br />[4] <em>Corrections Act </em>s77(1).<br />[5] <em>Corrections Act </em>s77(7)(b).<br />[6] Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 31 August 1982.<br />[7] (1995) 80 A Crim R 1.<br />[8] Unreported, Court of Appeal, 20 July 1995.<br />[9] Unreported, Court of Appeal, 22 February 1996.<br />[10] Unreported, Court of Appeal, 10 August 1995.<br />[11] (2004) 148 A Crim R 356 at 366.<br />[12] [2001] VSCA 143.<br />[13] <em>R v Renzella </em>[1997] 2 VR 88 at 98 per Winneke P, with whom Charles and Callaway JJ A agreed; <em>R v Stares </em>(2002) 4 VR 314 at 321 [21], 324 [31] per Charles JA with whom Phillips CJ and Chernov JA agreed; <em>R v Smith </em>[2006] VSCA 23 [8] per Chernov JA with whom Warren CJ and Charles JA agreed.<br />[14] See s16(3B) <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991.<br />[15] <em>R v Greenslade </em>[2004] VSCA 213 per Batt JA at [30].

S. breached the ICO by failing to comply with a condition of the order. She was later committed to prison for the then unexpired portion of the sentence. S. appealed to the County Court. The judge found the charge proven and adjourned the proceeding for a further assessment to determine whether S. was suitable for a further ICO. When the assessment report was filed with the court, a box on page 1 of the report was clearly checked positively to the effect that S. was suitable for an ICO. However, comments on page 2 of the report indicated that S''s suitability was heavily qualified and the comments expressed in guarded terms. After considering the report, the judge concluded that S. was not suitable for another ICO and committed her to prison for the unexpired portion of her sentence.</p>\r\n<p>Upon application for judicial review—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Application refused.</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;When a sentencer finds a charge proven that an offender has breached an ICO, the sentencer has to consider whether to impose a fine or not and then consider which of the three options specified in s26(3A) of the Sentencing Act 1991 (''Act'') should be adopted. That is, whether the ICO should be varied, confirmed or cancelled. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Section 19 of the Act is a general provision that relates to the making of ICOs. On the other hand, s26 is a specific provision that relates to the manner in which the breach of an ICO is to be dealt with. S26(3A) sets out the powers of the court and these are different from the powers of a court when a person is convicted of an offence to which s19(1) applies. Any report sought by the court on the breach of an ICO is considered by the judge in the exercise of sentencing powers under s26(3A) not s19(1).</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Upon a proper consideration of the whole of the circumstances, a sentencer, in a matter to which s26(3A) applies, might refuse to vary or confirm an intensive correction order despite a recommendation in a pre-sentence report to do so, and instead cancel the order and imprison the offender for the specified period. The sentencer might alternatively vary or confirm such an order and refuse to cancel it and imprison the offender even if this is not what the report recommended should happen. Section 26 leaves these matters to the proper consideration of the judge.</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The contents of the report were matters for the judge to consider and balance. He had to reconcile its different parts and assess what it was really saying. In doing so, he had to take into account the qualifications expressed on page 2. Having regard to the report as a whole, it was open to the judge to conclude that it made clear that the plaintiff was not suitable for an intensive correction order. No error of law was committed by the judge in his consideration of the report in this regard nor in his making of the final order. <br />&nbsp; <br />BELL J:<br />1.&nbsp;This is an application for judicial review brought under Order 56 of the Supreme Court Rules in respect of a decision of a judge of the County Court of Victoria made on 7 December 2004. The learned judge cancelled the plaintiff’s intensive correction order and committed her to prison for the unexpired period of her term of imprisonment pursuant to s26(3A)(c) of the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic). </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The plaintiff was convicted on 24 June 2003 in the Stawell Magistrates’ Court of the offences of failing to answer bail (four counts), trafficking in amphetamines, possessing money being the proceeds of crime and possession and use of amphetamines. These offences occurred between 11 August 2002 and 10 June 2003. She was sentenced to serve a period of six months imprisonment by way of an intensive correction order. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;On 23 June 2004, the plaintiff was convicted in the Horsham Magistrates’ Court of the offence of breaching the intensive correction order. She was committed to prison for the then unexpired portion of her sentence, being 182 days. Immediately after that hearing, she entered an appeal to the County Court of Victoria and was granted bail on her own undertaking. The appeal was heard in the County Court at Horsham on 3 December 2004. It proceeded by way of an appeal against sentence only. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;Section 26(1) of the Sentencing Act creates the offence of breach of an intensive correction order in the following terms:<br />&nbsp;<br />“(1) If at any time while an intensive correction order is in force the offender fails without reasonable excuse to comply with any condition of it or with any requirement of the regulations made for the purposes of this Subdivision, the offender is guilty of an offence for which he or she may be proceeded against on a charge filed by a prescribed person or a member of a prescribed class of persons.”</p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;Sections 26(3A) and (3B) make provision for the manner in which the hearing of a charge under sub-s(1) is to be dealt with and, where the offender is found guilty of the offence, the sentencing powers of the court. They provide as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“(3A) If on the hearing of a charge under sub-section (1) the court finds the offender guilty of the offence, it may impose a level 10 fine and in addition must—<br />(a) vary the intensive correction order; or<br />(b) confirm the order originally made; or<br />(c) cancel the order (if it is still in force) and, whether or not it is still in force, commit the offender to prison for the portion of the term of imprisonment to which he or she was sentenced that was unexpired at the date of the offence under sub-section (1).</p>\r\n<p>(3B) Despite anything to the contrary in sub-section (3A), if on the hearing of a charge the court finds the offender guilty of the offence and is satisfied that the offence was constituted, in whole or in part, by the offender committing, whether in or outside Victoria, another offence punishable by imprisonment during the period of the intensive correction order, it must, in addition to any fine it may impose under sub-section (3A), exercise the power referred to in paragraph (c) of that sub-section unless it is of the opinion that it would be unjust to do so in view of any exceptional circumstances which have arisen since the intensive correction order was made.”</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;In the present case, the breach of the intensive correction order was constituted by the plaintiff’s failure to comply with a condition of the order, not by the commission of an offence punishable by imprisonment. Therefore, s26(3B) did not operate to remove the discretions conferred by s26(3A).[1] </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The judge found the charge to be proven. In consequence, he had to consider whether to impose a fine and, further, which of the three sentencing options specified in s26(3A) would be adopted. After hearing a plea in mitigation from counsel for the plaintiff, the judge determined to have her further assessed by the Office of Corrections to determine her suitability for a further intensive correction order. The judge adjourned the plaintiff’s case for sentence on 7 December 2004. On that date, a pre-sentence report dated 3 December 2004 was supplied to the judge. The plaintiff was again legally represented, as was the firstnamed defendant. On this day, the judge made the decision for which judicial review is now sought. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The judicial review jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria referred to in Order 56 of the Supreme Court Rules applies to decisions, including sentencing decisions, of the County Court of Victoria.[2] The jurisdiction being discretionary, there is a principle that the Court might decline to grant the relief sought upon the ground that there was another equally effective and convenient remedy.[3] This is not a consideration in the instant case because there is no remedy available to the plaintiff other than judicial review under Order 56.[4] </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that orders in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the judge should be made. This submission was made upon the grounds that the judge made two reviewable errors:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) An error of law on the face of the record; and <br />(2) An error of jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>(1) Error of law on the face of the record<br />10.&nbsp;The submissions made by counsel for the plaintiff depend upon a consideration of the reasons for decision of the judge. There was no transcript of those reasons. The only evidence of the reasons is that set out in paragraph 15 of the affidavit of the plaintiff dated 28 January 2005, upon the basis of which the proceeding in this Court were instituted. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;Paragraph 15 of the plaintiff’s affidavit is in the following terms:<br />&nbsp;<br />“15. His Honour in dismissing my Appeal stated that the Office of Corrections Report made it was clear that I was not suitable for an Intensive Corrections Order yet the report concludes that I was suitable. It did say that I had refused to consent to a condition that I now [sic] associate with Jason Yanner with whom I have been in a relationship for a number of years and while I did indicate to the Office of Corrections that I wished to maintain contact with him including visiting him in custody, I was agreeable to a condition that I not reside with him during the period of any Intensive Corrections Order if I was given the opportunity of being placed on such an Order. In any event on the same day as His Honour sentenced me, he also sentenced Jason Yanner to a period of imprisonment of 18 months with a minimum to be served of 12 months for other offences not related to me. As the term of the Intensive Corrections Order being considered in my case was significantly less than the minimum term His Honour sentenced Jason Yanner to, it would have been impossible for me to reside with him during the period of my Order anyway.”</p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;Relief in the nature of certiorari is available upon the ground that the decision-maker has committed an error of law on the face of the record.[5] However, in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, the record of an inferior court for the purpose of certiorari does not ordinarily include the reasons for the decision, whether or not these were recorded in a transcript or a statement of reasons.[6] In Victoria, there is a statutory provision to the contrary. Section 10 of the Administrative Law Act 1978 (Vic) provides as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“10. Any statement by a tribunal or inferior court whether made orally or in writing, and whether or not made pursuant to a request or order under section 8, of its reasons for a decision shall be taken to form part of the decision and accordingly to be incorporated in the record.”</p>\r\n<p>In consequence, for the purpose of determining whether an error of law on the face of the record has been committed, this Court may consider an oral or written statement of the reasons for decision of a tribunal or inferior court. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;The first question that arises is whether, in the absence of a transcript, reasons of a decision-maker as proved in an affidavit may be treated as part of a record for the purposes of s10 of the Administrative Law Act. In the present case, the Court cannot grant relief by way of judicial review for error of law upon the face of the record unless it is satisfied that reasons proved in this way form part of the record. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;Section 10 of the Administrative Law Act does not deal in terms with the manner in which the written or oral statement of reasons may by proved. In that regard, the general laws of evidence apply. Therefore, where the statement was made in a written document, the statement may be proved by reference to the document.[7] Where the statement was made orally and transcribed, the statement may be proved by reference to the transcript.[8] Where the statement was made orally and not transcribed, the statement may be proved by reference to an appropriate affidavit, such as an affidavit of a person who was present when the reasons for decision were announced.[9] That person may be the applicant for judicial review, as in the present case, or their legal representative, as in other cases. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Although the plaintiff was therefore entitled to prove the statement of reasons of the judge by an affidavit, her affidavit gives a one-sentence account of those reasons. Where a plaintiff intends to prove, by affidavit, a non-transcribed oral statement of reasons for decision of a tribunal or inferior tribunal so as to have them taken to be part of the record pursuant to s10 of the Administrative Law Act, the affidavit should give an adequate account of those stated reasons. The account must at least be sufficient to enable the Court to appreciate the substance of the reasons for the decision of which judicial review is sought. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;Although the firstnamed defendant was represented in the proceeding before the judge, no answering affidavit was filed. Having regard to the scant nature of the account given of the judge’s reasons in the plaintiff’s affidavit, it is surprising that this course was taken, at least in the absence of an explanation. An application for judicial review for error of law on the face of the record is a proceeding inter partes and is adversarial in nature. If a plaintiff files an affidavit setting out a statement of reasons given orally and not transcribed, and the affidavit is not adequate and not answered, the Court may have to treat the affidavit, despite its inadequacy, as the only evidence available of those reasons. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;In the present case the state of the evidence of the reasons for decision of the judge is unsatisfactory. So that the substance of the plaintiff’s arguments may be addressed, the Court is prepared to assume that the plaintiff’s account of the reasons for decision of the judge form part of the record under s10 of the Administrative Law Act. Upon this basis, it is necessary to consider whether the judge made an error of law on the face of the record. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that an error of law was made in three alternative respects:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) The judge cancelled the intensive correction order upon the basis that the plaintiff was considered not to be suitable for such an order by the Office of Corrections when, in fact, the Office of Corrections had found that she was considered to be suitable.</p>\r\n<p>(b) The judge attached weight to the plaintiff’s refusal to consent to the suggested condition by the Office of Corrections that she not associate with a certain person.</p>\r\n<p>(c) The judge considered himself to be bound by the adverse recommendation in the pre-sentence report.</p>\r\n<p>(a) Plaintiff’s suitability for intensive correction order<br />18.&nbsp;The pre-sentence report contained a box on page 1 that was clearly checked positively for the following statement: “Is suitable for an Intensive Corrections Order: Core conditions only”. However, on page 2 the following comments appeared:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Tammy has agreed to the core conditions of an Intensive Corrections Order.</p>\r\n<p>For Tammy to successfully complete an ICO it was put to her that;</p>\r\n<p>(1) She reside with her parents at 18 Eldridge Road, Red Cliffs – telephone 50224 2086 for the period of the order. Tammy consented to this condition. A discussion was had with Mr Shalders (Tammy’s stepfather) and it appears they are supportive and strict, placing conditions upon Tammy that would support her in completing the order. However, she may quickly find these conditions overbearing and cause difficulties within the family unit which would require her to leave the residence. Particularly in relation to her ongoing contact with YANNER, which her parents strongly disapprove of.<br />&nbsp;<br />(2) That Tammy have does not associate with Jason Yanner. Tammy refused to consent to this condition. Tammy claims she will not reside with YANNER but wishes to maintain contact by mail, telephone and visiting him in custody. Taking this into consideration it would appear highly likely that on his release Tammy would consider cohabitation with YANNER at which time her ability to complete an ICO would be totally negated. It is further noted that Tammy was at the Horsham Police Station visiting YANNER when the author attended the station.</p>\r\n<p>At this time Tammy has only been residing with her parents for 1 month and has had the concern of her appeal pending. Once this Court based motivation has been removed she would need to adhere to both her parents and corrections.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that whilst finding her suitable for the Intensive Corrections Order, this order will be managed strictly by the Mildura Corrections Centre and any deviance from the requirements will result in her being returned to the sentencing Judge.”</p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the judge was clearly wrong to sentence the plaintiff upon the basis that the Office of Corrections had “made it clear”[10] that the plaintiff was unsuited to a further intensive correction order. The positive checking of the box on page 1 of the pre-sentence report showed that the Office of Corrections were of the opposite view.[11] It was submitted that, in proceeding upon that basis, the judge erred in law in that he failed properly to apprehend and discharge his function under s29(3A) of the Sentencing Act. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;If the pre-sentence report contained only the checked box on page 1, there may be substance in the criticisms of counsel for the plaintiff and it would then be necessary to consider whether an error of law had been established. However, the report must be read as a whole. The statement that the plaintiff was suitable on page 1 was heavily qualified by the comments on page 2. The concluding paragraph of those comments was expressed in heavily guarded terms. The contents of the report were matters for the judge to consider and balance. He had to reconcile its different parts and assess what it was really saying. In doing so, he had to take into account the qualifications expressed on page 2. It is not established that he did not do so. Having regard to the report as a whole, it was open to the judge to conclude that it made clear that the plaintiff was not suitable for an intensive correction order. No error of law was committed by the judge in his consideration of the report in this regard. </p>\r\n<p>(b) Refusal to consent not to associate with another person<br />21.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the judge erroneously attached weight to the refusal by the plaintiff to consent to a condition suggested by the Office of Corrections that she not associate with Mr Jason Yanner. A related submission was that Mr Yanner had, in any event, been imprisoned for a period of some 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months so that such a condition would have been meaningless. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;An application for judicial review of a sentencing decision by a judge of the County Court of Victoria is not in the nature of a re-hearing of the plaintiff’s plea in mitigation.[12] Unless the plaintiff establishes that a judicially reviewable error was made, such as an error of law on the face of the record or a jurisdictional error, the grounds upon which judicial review might be granted will not have been made out.[13] The fact that the judge attached weight to a particular matter will not ordinarily constitute a reviewable error; where the matter was legally irrelevant, the position may be different, but this was not the case here.[14] </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;The evidence established that, prior to and on the same day as the judge sentenced the plaintiff, he sentenced Mr Yanner to a period of 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, in consequence, it was not open to the judge to place weight upon the plaintiff’s refusal to consent to the condition not to associate with him. This submission must be rejected. This matter fell entirely within the judge’s consideration of the plaintiff’s circumstances. At the time of sentencing the plaintiff, the judge could not have known whether Mr Yanner might successfully appeal against the sentence imposed upon him, whether he might be released on bail pending such an appeal and so on. The judge may have been concerned about the possibility of the plaintiff continuing the relationship by visiting Mr Yanner in prison. Moreover, even putting aside Mr Yanner’s sentence, the fact that the plaintiff was not prepared to consent to the condition suggested by the Office of Corrections might reasonably have been taken into account by the judge. There was no error involved in this aspect of the judge’s consideration. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;I was informed by counsel for the plaintiff that the second sentence in paragraph 15 of the plaintiff’s affidavit described matters put to this Court and not to the County Court judge. These matters are, therefore, of limited, if any, relevance in this Court. This Court was also informed that Mr Yanner had appealed his sentence because a co-accused had received a sentence of only six months imprisonment. This matter is likewise irrelevant. </p>\r\n<p>(c) Section 19 of the Sentencing Act<br />25.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the judge erred in failing to appreciate that he could vary or confirm the intensive correction order under s26(3A) of the Sentencing Act even if, as he concluded, the Office of Corrections advised that the plaintiff was not suitable for such an order. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that, in the matter before the County Court judge, s. 19(1) operated to allow him to accept or reject the pre-sentence report and place the plaintiff on an intensive correction order if he considered that this was appropriate. It was submitted that the judge did not appreciate that he had this discretion under this section. It was submitted that, if the judge had to act entirely under s26(3A), he did not appreciate that he had an equal discretion under that section. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;Section 19 of the Sentencing Act provides as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“(1) If a person is convicted by a court of an offence and the court—<br />(a) is considering sentencing him or her to a term of imprisonment; and<br />(b) has received a pre-sentence report—<br />the court, if satisfied that it is desirable to do so in the circumstances, may impose a sentence of imprisonment of not more than one year and order that it be served by way of intensive correction in the community.”</p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;Section 19 specifies two conditions that must be satisfied before a court can order that a sentence of imprisonment be served by way of intensive correction in the community. The first is that the Court is considering the imprisonment of the offender and the second is that it has received a pre-sentence report. Sections 96-99 of the Sentencing Act make provision in relation to the order, contents, distribution and disputing of pre-sentence reports. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;Section 19 does not, in terms, have the effect that a court’s jurisdiction to make an intensive correction order is dependent upon the receipt of a pre-sentence report that contains a positive, or any, recommendation that the offender is suitable for such an order. It is implicit in s19 and ss96-99 that it will ultimately be for the Court to determine whether the offender should be placed upon such an order. This decision will be made by the judge upon a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, which will include, but may not be confined to, the contents of the report. There may be few occasions where a court would make an intensive correction order in the face of an adverse pre-sentence report, but the legislation leaves that course open. One such circumstance could be that evidence provided to the Court, but not to the author of the report, showed that its factual foundation was faulty.[15] </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;As noted above, counsel for the plaintiff partly based his submissions upon the applicability of the provisions of s19(1) of the Sentencing Act to the sentencing of an offender under s26(3A). These submissions cannot be accepted because s19(1) does not apply to the hearing of charges for breach of an intensive correction order under s26(3A). </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;Section 19 is a general provision that relates to the making of orders by which sentences of imprisonment are to be served by way of intensive correction in the community. Section 19(1) specifies the conditions that govern the making of such orders and limits the term of the sentence, and order, to a maximum period of one year (see further below). On the other hand, s26 is a specific provision that relates to the manner in which the breach of an intensive correction order is to be dealt with. Section 26(3A) sets out the powers of a court on the hearing of a charge of breach under s26(1). These are different to the powers of a court when a person is convicted of an offence of a kind to which s19(1) applies. A court considering the sentencing options specified in s26(3A) may order a pre-sentence report under s96(1) because that provision allows a report to be made in these circumstances. Where a report is so ordered, s19(1) does not govern its use. The report is considered by the judge in the exercise of his or her sentencing powers under s26(3A), not s19(1). </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff made a similar submission in relation to the judge’s application of s26(3A), namely that the judge acted upon the basis that he was bound to follow a recommendation in a pre-sentence report. The terms of s26(3A) do not fetter the exercise of the Court’s powers in this way. Neither do the provisions of ss96-99. Under s26(3A), the Court may fine and then must vary or confirm the order, or cancel the order and imprison the offender for the specified period, as the Court determines may be appropriate in the circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;Depending upon the circumstances, the contents of a pre-sentence report may be a material, even a decisive, consideration in the exercise of the sentencing powers in s26(3A). The operation of s26(3A) is not different from s19(1) in this respect. Upon a proper consideration of the whole of the circumstances, the trial judge, in a matter to which s26(3A) applies, might refuse to vary or confirm an intensive correction order despite a recommendation in a pre-sentence report to do so, and instead cancel the order and imprison the offender for the specified period. The judge might alternatively vary or confirm such an order and refuse to cancel it and imprison the offender even if this is not what the report recommended should happen. Section 26 leaves these matters to the proper consideration of the judge. </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the judge considered himself to be bound by the adverse recommendation in the report that the plaintiff was not suitable for an intensive correction order.[16] If the judge had considered himself to be so bound, he would not have properly performed the powers conferred by s26(3A) (or alternatively, s19(1)). However, on the evidence before this Court, it cannot be concluded that the judge approached the matter in this way. As already observed, the plaintiff’s scant account of the judge’s reasons is to the effect that the pre-sentence report made clear that the plaintiff was not suitable for an intensive correction order. The plaintiff’s account does not state that the judge reasoned that he must therefore necessarily cancel the order and imprison the plaintiff for the specified period. Nor is there any basis for inferring that he reached that conclusion. The overwhelming likelihood is that the judge considered that, in all of the circumstances, including the contents of the report, it was appropriate for him to proceed under s26(3A)(c). In doing so the judge exercised the judgment that s26(3A) required of him, without error of law. </p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;The plaintiff’s submission that the judge committed an error of law on the face of the record must therefore be rejected. </p>\r\n<p>(2) An error of jurisdiction.<br />36.&nbsp;The submissions of counsel for the plaintiff in support of this ground where in substance different ways of putting the propositions in the submissions already made in support of the first ground. </p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;The first submission was that the judge committed a jurisdictional error in that he exceeded or failed properly to discharge his jurisdiction under s26(3A) of the Sentencing Act by misunderstanding the nature of the functions conferred by that section. This submission was based principally upon the plaintiff’s criticisms of the manner in which the judge dealt with the issue of her suitability for a further intensive correction order and the pre-sentence report. For the reasons given above, it was not established that the judge misunderstood these functions or erred in law in the way that he dealt with that suitability or the report. </p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;The second submission was that the judge committed a jurisdictional error by erroneously attaching weight to the refusal of the plaintiff to consent to the condition suggested by the Office of Corrections that she not associate with Mr Yanner. This submission must also be rejected as the judge’s consideration of this issue was carried out entirely within his jurisdiction, the weight to be attributed to the relevant matters being a matter for him. </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;The third submission was that the judge committed a jurisdictional error by considering himself to be bound by the pre-sentence report when, under s19(1), or alternatively s26(3A), of the Sentencing Act, he was not so bound. It has already been concluded that the judge did not approach the matter in this way. This submission must be rejected upon the same basis. </p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;The plaintiff’s submissions that the judge committed a jurisdictional error must therefore be rejected. </p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;The plaintiff’s originating motion is dismissed with costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] Portelli (2000) 118 A Crim R 172. <br />[2] Kuek v Wellens and County Court of Victoria [2002] VSCA 31 at [4]; Sidebottom v County Court (Vic) (2001) 117 A Crim R 574 at 578; see also Thompson v His Honour Judge Byrne and Others [1998] 2 VR 274 at 275. <br />[3] R v Hillingdon London Borough Council; Ex parte Royco Homes Ltd [1974] QB 720 at 728. <br />[4] Kuek at [4]; Sidebottom at 578. <br />[5] Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 180. <br />[6] Craig at 181. <br />[7] Thompson at 280 and the authorities there cited. <br />[8] Hansford v Judge Neesham (1994) 7 VAR 172 at 180; Ioannidis v Guardian Holdings Pty Ltd (1994) 8 VAR 140 at 146; Sidebottom at 579. <br />[9] Ioannidis at 146; Kuek v Wellens and County Court of Victoria [2002] VSC 326 (the decision at first instance) at [28] (the Court of Appeal noted without disapproval that the reasons for decisions were found in the plaintiff’s affidavit); Munro v Chris Brack and Anor [2000] VSC 299 at [14]-[15] (where the affidavit account of the reasons was found to be consistent with a video of the proceedings); the point was left open in Hansford at 180. <br />[10] See par 15 of the plaintiff’s affidavit. <br />[11] There is a guarded comment to similar effect in the last sentence of the comments on page 2 of the pre-sentence report. <br />[12] Sidebottom at 580; see also Kuek v Victoria Legal Aid (2001) 3 VR 289 at 293. <br />[13] Kuek v Wellens (at first instance) at [15]. <br />[14] See generally Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41-42. <br />[15] Section 99, which deals with disputing pre-sentence reports, contemplates that this might happen. <br />[16] See par 15 of the plaintiff’s affidavit.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the Plaintiff Slater: Mr A Marshall, counsel.

After considering C.''s personal factors, and the question of delay, the magistrate found that exceptional circumstances existed and granted bail to C. on strict conditions. Upon appeal—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Appeal refused.<br />1.&nbsp;The concept of "exceptional circumstances" is an elusive one. The phrase is not defined in the Bail Act 1977 and some judges of the Supreme Court have made it clear that such circumstances may exist as a result of the interaction of a variety of factors which of themselves might not be regarded as exceptional. What is ultimately of significance is that viewed as a whole, the circumstances can be regarded as exceptional to the extent that, taking into account the very serious nature of the charge to which they are applicable, the making of an order admitting the person to bail would be justified.<br />&nbsp;Re Moloney, Sup Ct, unrep., Vincent J, 31 October 1990, applied.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The concept of delay has been dealt with in many cases. It is a matter of some sensitivity where the person incarcerated has the benefit of the presumption of innocence and it must be borne steadily in mind that bail is not about punishment in advance of a jury trial, but is designed to secure attendance at that trial. Accordingly, whilst there is necessarily a level of pragmatism involved in the concept of delay, its operation cannot be limited by reference to what is currently regarded as “normal” for the prosecutorial process. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />3.&nbsp;Despite the seriousness of the offences, the prospective delay, together with the other factors to which the Magistrate referred in her decision are all capable, in combination, of constituting exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, it was open to the magistrate to have concluded that exceptional circumstances existed so as to justify the grant of bail.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>COLDREY J:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />1.&nbsp;On 30 March 2005, at the Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne, the respondent, Sabino Cozzi was admitted to bail on his own undertaking on charges of cultivating a narcotic plant (cannabis) being a commercial quantity; two counts of possessing cannabis and one count of trafficking a large commercial quantity of cannabis (23/3/05); there was an additional charge of cultivate a narcotic plant (cannabis) being a large commercial quantity (1/9/04 – 23/3/05). </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The following special conditions were imposed on the grant of bail: <br />“1. Report to Glen Waverley Police Station daily between 6.00 a.m. and 9.00 p.m.;<br />2.&nbsp;Reside at 53 Holmbury Blv, Mulgrave Vic. 3170; <br />3.&nbsp;Surrender all valid passports or any other valid travel document held within 24 hours of release to the Informant; <br />4.&nbsp;Not attend any points of international departure; <br />5.&nbsp;Not leave Australia; <br />6.&nbsp;Not associate with any co-accused.”</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;On 22 April 2005, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of appeal against the grant of bail. It specified the following grounds: <br />“1. THAT the learned Magistrate in proceeding to grant bail to the Respondent erred in finding, pursuant to s4(2)(aa)(i) of the Bail Act 1977 that there were ‘exceptional circumstances’;<br />2(a) THAT in granting bail to the Respondent the learned Magistrate gave undue weight to; <br />Parity in terms of the fact that a co-defendant Dennis Sofianos was granted bail;<br />The fact that the Respondent has a stable residence;<br />The Respondent’s ties to the jurisdiction;<br />The likely delay in proceedings;<br />The Respondent’s family support;<br />The Respondent’s bail history;<br />The Respondent’s health;<br />2(b) THAT in granting bail to the Respondent, the learned Magistrate failed to accord sufficient weight to:<br />The fact that the likely delay in the proceedings is not greater than usual.”</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;In summary, the circumstances giving rise to the charges are that on 23 March 2005, police who were on a property adjacent to 269 Old Cape Schanck Road Boneo for matters unrelated to that before this Court, detected the smell of cannabis emanating from the latter property. They observed five hot houses (or igloos) on that property which, upon investigation, were found to contain numerous cannabis plants. While on the premises the respondent was disturbed as he was about to enter one of the hot houses. Upon observing the police the respondent turned and started to move quickly away. He was apprehended and was found to be carrying a pair of orange handled scissors. He immediately denied any knowledge of the cannabis plants. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;Later the same afternoon a co-accused Sofianos was apprehended when he arrived at the property. Apart from making full admissions in relation to the cultivation of the crop (and, incidentally, implicating the respondent) Sofianos showed police a room in a dwelling situated on the property which was being used to dry and prepare the cannabis for packaging. There was a large quantity of dried cannabis on the floor in this room and a number of wires strung across the room with cannabis drying. Amongst other items located in this room was a roll of black plastic garbage bags. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;A subsequent search of the respondent’s motor vehicle revealed a roll of black plastic garbage bags that were identical to those found in the drying room as well as a brochure from an estate agent who managed the rental of the property where the cannabis was found. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The respondent maintained that he had no knowledge of the cannabis, stating that he was on the premises to cut flowers. Whilst there were flowers on the property they were not in the vicinity of where the respondent was initially observed. Also found in the appellant’s possession was a business card for a shop that provided hydroponic equipment. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;On 24 March 2005, the cannabis was examined and weighed by a botanist at 1,479 kilograms. It was, however, clear that the weight of the actual usable material – the dry weight – was about 25% of the total weight. Nonetheless, this would result in an amount of in excess of 350 kilograms, sufficient to constitute a large commercial quantity, with a value of between $1.5 and 2.5 million. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The material before the Magistrate indicated that the respondent was a 55 year old married man who lived with his wife and two of his four daughters in suburban Mulgrave. His two other daughters were married but apparently also lived within the jurisdiction. Both he and his wife were unemployed but the household was supported by contributions made by all of the daughters. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;The respondent’s wife had been diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2004, and had undergone surgery, and subsequent chemo and radiotherapy. The respondent was designated as a primary carer for his wife in her post-cancer phase although there was some evidence that she was capable of driving herself around. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;The respondent’s own medical condition was the subject of a report from a Dr Francis Tien Nguyen of the Waverley Police Road Medical Centre. It indicated that he had type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, ferritin (an excess iron in the blood), gastritis, a fatty liver, and a thyroid nodule. The evidence indicated that he had to have a scan in April in relation to the thyroid and that he took medication for his diabetes and cholesterol. The result of any scan was not before this Court. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;The respondent had a number of prior convictions commencing in 1977. These included gaming offences, minor assaults and offences for selling heroin (1981) and trafficking and using heroin (1996) for which he had received 9 months’ imprisonment and a 6 months’ suspended sentence respectively. It was nine years since the last conviction and the respondent had no history of failing to answer bail. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;In the initial bail hearing counsel for the respondent relied on what he asserted to be a weak Crown case and that for the respondent “to remain in custody would put in jeopardy his health and make home life for his wife extremely difficult.” </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;In her oral reasons, the Magistrate referred to parity (she having found in favour of the bail application of co-defendant Sofianos) and the respondent’s ties to the jurisdiction, ties to the family and stable family support. The Magistrate further commented that there would be some delay or some considerable delay in the matter reaching the trial stage. The Magistrate also found that the respondent did not pose any risk of absconding or committing any further offences. Indeed the informant expressed the view that the respondent would not abscond. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;In neither her written nor oral reasons did the Magistrate specifically refer to the strength or otherwise of the Crown case or upon the role of the respondent as a carer for his wife. However, as the Full Court said in the case of Beljajev &amp; Anor v DPP (Victoria) and DPP (Commonwealth)[1]:<br />&nbsp;<br />“In a bail application which is necessarily interlocutory and founded largely on hearsay and assertion, the judge is not obliged to state in his reasons every matter which he has taken into account or the weight which he has attributed to any particular matter. A decision to grant or refuse bail must necessarily be to a very considerable extent a matter of impression or an instinctive synthesis of the considerations involved.”</p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;The principles applicable to a Director’s appeal are regarded as having been set out in the decision of the Full Court in Beljajev. In that case the Court (Young CJ, Crockett and Ashley JJ) stated[2]: <br />“It is not essential that the Director should be able to show an error of law in the narrow sense, although of course if error of law were demonstrated this Court would be obliged to substitute its own view of the order which should have been made. It is also open to the Director to show that in all the circumstances of the case the order was manifestly the wrong order to make even though it is not possible to point to any other identifiable error in the process by which the authority granting bail arrived at the order made.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, the Director is not in our opinion, confined to relying upon an error of law as a ground of appeal but may succeed if he shows that on any ground, whether of fact or law, the discretion of the primary judge has miscarried and can persuade the Supreme Court that a different order should have been made.</p>\r\n<p>There are, however, two ways of the first importance in which an appeal in a matter of bail differs from an appeal against sentence. Both stem from the very nature of bail. The first is that an order admitting a person to bail is not a final order: it may be revoked at any time. The second is that the granting of bail is essentially a matter of practice and procedure. These two considerations both independently and in combination operate to impose on any appellate court a severe restraint upon interference with the order appealed from. In civil and in criminal cases alike appellate courts have frequently refused to interfere with a primary judge’s decision on a matter of practice and procedure.”[3]</p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;As the cases indicate[4] it is not a question of whether the appellate court would have granted bail had that Court been hearing the application at first instance. Rather, it is whether the material in front of the Magistrate could never have amounted to “exceptional circumstances”. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;The concept of exceptional circumstances is, itself, an elusive one. The phrase itself is not defined in the Bail Act 1997 (the Act), although some Judges have essayed a definition. In Tang &amp; Ors[5], Beach J made reference to dictionary definitions of the word “exceptional”. His Honour found that whatever definition was used, the applicant for bail “bears an onus of establishing that there is some unusual or uncommon circumstance surrounding his case before a court is justified in releasing him on bail”.[6] In the course of argument the decision of Kaye J in the case of In the Matter of a Bail Application by Ismail Muhaidat[7] was cited. In it his Honour remarked (p.2): <br />“The question of what are exceptional circumstances have been canvassed before. Effectively the applicant has to establish circumstances right out of the ordinary. They have to be exceptional to the ordinary circumstances which would otherwise entitle the applicant to bail.”<br />19.&nbsp;On the other hand in Re the Matter of Application for Bail by John Denis Moloney[8] Vincent J, a most experienced Judge, pointed out that it was not possible to identify in any general definition what factual situations constituted exceptional circumstances. His Honour stated: </p>\r\n<p>“A number of decisions which have been handed down by Judges in this Court, however, make it clear that such circumstances may exist as a result of the interaction of a variety of factors which of themselves might not be regarded as exceptional. What is ultimately of significance is that viewed as a whole, the circumstances can be regarded as exceptional to the extent that, taking into account the very serious nature of the charge to which they are applicable, the making of an order admitting the person to bail would be justified.”</p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;I agree with respect with his Honour’s approach. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;An examination of the cases bearing upon this concept reveals a multitude of single and conflicting interpretations thrown up, no doubt, by the variety of fact situations with which Judges have been faced. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;Among the major factors found to constitute exceptional circumstances have been the strength of the Crown case (where that may be sensibly assessed); the question of delay to committal and/or trial; and principles of parity (insofar as they are applicable to a bail application). As to the many other factors that courts have taken into account I use as examples only those cases cited in argument before this Court, which constitute but a representative sample. In DPP v Nguyen[9] the fact that the Magistrate had taken into account, in addition to issues of the strength of the Crown case, delay and parity, strong family support, stable accommodation, employment and low risk of flight or re-offending was accepted by the Judge without adverse comment. Similarly, in Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Banda[10] which was, like Nguyen, a Director’s appeal, the Magistrate, in finding exceptional circumstances, took into account family situation and personal situation of the respondent including his primary role in caring for his mother, a significant role in caring for a surrogate father with serious health problems, his provision of financial support for a former partner looking after their intellectually handicapped daughter, work commitments, a strong attachment to the State and a lack of any unacceptable risk that the respondent may abscond and/or commit further offences as relevant factors, quite apart from potential delay or the principle of parity. The Judge was not persuaded that the Magistrate’s decision that there were exceptional circumstances was manifestly wrong. In the case of In the Matter of an Application for Bail by Andrea Mantase[11] such factors as lack of any prior criminal history, constant employment, an unlikelihood of absconding and the personal situation of the applicant’s wife who had recently had a miscarriage were factors which, together with likely delay, were found to constitute exceptional circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;Ostensibly on the other side of the ledger is another case referred to in argument, namely In the Matter of an Application for Bail by Ryan Leigh Johns[12]. That was a case in which the age of the appellant (19 at the time of the alleged murder offence) and his personal circumstances (residence with his mother and the availability of a job) were not, in the circumstances, found to be exceptional, albeit the Judge did not rule such factors could not never constitute exceptional circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;On the other hand, in In the Matter of a Bail Application by Ismail Muhaidat[13] Kaye J expressed the view that hardship to an applicant or his family, and disruption to his work constituted only “ordinary circumstances”. Although, later in the ruling, his Honour found that the fact that the applicant’s de facto was to give birth to their child in the very near future, potentially qualified as an exceptional circumstance, he ultimately found that such circumstances were not made out. His Honour also distinguished between potential and actual delay as a factor. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;This brief examination indicates, in my view, that there are a variety of factors taken into account by courts in considering the question of exceptional circumstances. In each case it appears to be a question of degree. Moreover, the lack of matters constituting unacceptable risk, detailed in s4(2)(d) are often taken into consideration. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;As Beljajev’s case[14] makes clear that subsection will need to be satisfied even when the hurdle of exceptional circumstances has been jumped, but it does not follow that the fact that an applicant is an acceptable risk cannot constitute a factor in the determination of such circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;I take paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of the Director’s Notice as essentially particulars of the grounds set out in paragraph 1. Moreover, as I understand the submissions of the appellant (putting to one side the issue of parity) it is not suggested that it was not open to the Magistrate to make the findings that she did, although there were some critical comments made by counsel as to the extent of the evidence upon which such findings were based. Essentially the appellant’s case was that these factors, even in combination, could never amount to exceptional circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;Insofar as the issue of parity is concerned, it was submitted that the original decision to admit Sofianos to bail was wrong and consequently the respondent could not rely upon it. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;I interpolate that in the course of argument the Court was informed that the abandoning of an appeal instigated in the case of Sofianos stemmed from the subsequent assistance he had provided to the investigating police in obtaining evidence against an alleged third offender. Indeed it was indicated that Sofianos had applied to go into the witness protection regime. These factors were, of course, not relevant to the issue of parity before the Magistrate or, indeed, this Court, a circumstance which serves to reinforce the comments of the Full Court in Beljajev to the effect that the changing factual situations which are likely to attend bail applications, enlivening both fresh applications for bail or for revocation, may make the appellate process a cumbersome and ill-suited vehicle to resolve this interlocutory matter. Indeed, in terms of the passage of time, I note that this Court is faced with a situation where the respondent has already been complying with the bail conditions fixed by the Magistrate for a period in excess of two months. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;In any event the factors which applied to Sofianos at that time, including his co-operation with the police, the fact that he had already been on bail (albeit for only a week), his lack of convictions for in excess of 15 years, and the evidence of the informant that he personally would be quite satisfied if the defendant remained on bail, distinguishes his situation from that of the respondent. Accordingly, whether or not Sofianos should have been granted bail, the differing circumstances of the two defendants render parity an inappropriate consideration in determining any grant of bail to the respondent. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;Insofar as the strength of the prosecution case is concerned, I have already indicated that the Magistrate did not make any specific comment on this issue. Given the early stage of proceedings, including the ongoing status of the police investigation, this is not surprising. But it follows that the respondent cannot call in aid any weakness in the Crown case in seeking to support the finding of exceptional circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;It was argued by the appellant that there was no evidence that the Magistrate found any great or inordinate delay. However, I note the transcript reference by the Magistrate to “considerable delay”. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;The concept of delay has been dealt with in many cases.[15] It is a matter of some sensitivity where the person incarcerated has the benefit of the presumption of innocence and it must be borne steadily in mind that bail is not about punishment in advance of a jury trial, but is designed to secure attendance at that trial.[16] Accordingly, whilst there is necessarily a level of pragmatism involved in the concept of delay its operation cannot be limited by reference to what is currently regarded as “normal” for the prosecutorial process. </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;In the present case, the Magistrate, who has great practical experience of the system, regarded the delay before this prosecution ever came to trial as considerable. Nothing was advanced by the prosecution on the question of the overall delay contrary to that view. </p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;Ultimately, but not without some hesitation, I have come to the view that, despite the seriousness of the offences, the prospective delay, together with the other factors to which the Magistrate referred in her decision (which I need not repeat but which I regard as encompassing the situation of his wife) are all capable, in combination, of constituting exceptional circumstances. Whether this Court would have made that finding at that time is not to the point. The question is whether it was open to the Magistrate to have done so. I have concluded that it was. </p>\r\n<p>36.&nbsp;That, in my view, is an end to the matter.

The provisions of Order 35 of the <em>Magistrates Court Civil Procedure Rules </em>(Rules) permit a court to order that any document in the proceeding be amended for the purpose of determining the real question in issue between the parties or of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings.<br />&nbsp;<em>McKenzie v Commonwealth of Australia </em>[2001] VSC 361, applied.<br />2.&nbsp;Where a magistrate refused to allow a party leave to file an amended defence on the grounds that the amendment should have been raised a lot earlier and that the applicant party was guilty of delay, the magistrate failed to give effect to Order 35 of the Rules and accordingly was in error.&nbsp;<br /><br />GILLARD J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;In this proceeding instituted by originating motion, the plaintiff seeks judicial review of a decision made by a magistrate sitting at Dandenong, who refused an application by the plaintiff as defendant in the proceeding for leave to file and serve an amended defence. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;After the learned magistrate pronounced his decision, the Magistrates’ Court proceeding was adjourned to enable the defendant in the proceeding, the present plaintiff, to bring a proceeding in this Court to review the decision. <br /><strong>Parties <br />3.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff, Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Ltd ("the insurer"), is an insurance company and at the relevant time insured a vehicle owned by Warwick Leigh King ("Mr King"), the first defendant in this proceeding. Mr King owned a 1999 Holden HSV utility motor vehicle, which he alleged was involved in a collision at Cockatoo on or about 23 October 2005, and as a result was damaged.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The second defendant is the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Dandenong. In accordance with the normal practice, the Court has informed this Court that it will not take part in the proceeding and will abide by the result.<br /><strong>Proceeding in Magistrates’ Court <br />5.</strong>&nbsp;On 13 January 2006, Mr King, through his solicitors, filed a complaint in the Magistrates’ Court sitting at Dandenong, claiming damages for breach of contract against the insurer, and alleging that the insurer had failed to indemnify him in respect to the damage caused to his vehicle in a collision which occurred on or about 23 October 2005 in Cockatoo. Mr King claimed the sum of $26,000. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;On 10 February 2006, the insurer’s solicitors forwarded to Mr King’s solicitors its notice of defence. The insurer admitted ownership, that it had insured Mr King, that it was involved in a collision, and that he had made a claim on the insurer. It denied it was in breach of contract for failing to indemnify him. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;In paragraph 10, the insurer alleged that Mr King had a duty to co-operate in making a claim. It was alleged in paragraph 11 that he had failed to co-operate by failing to provide certain information which had been requested. The information requested was his telephone account, listing all mobile telephone calls made for the period 22 October to 26 October 2005. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;It was then asserted that in the circumstances, because he had failed to provide the information, the defendant was not in a position to accept or deny his claim. It is important to note that at that point, the defence did not allege that the insurer had denied the claim. What was alleged was that the insurer required further information before making a decision. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrates’ Court fixed the matter for hearing on 6 July 2006 at Dandenong. By facsimile sent on 30 June 2006, the insurer’s solicitors delivered to Mr King’s solicitors a proposed draft amended defence. This was some six days prior to the hearing. On 5 July 2006, the insurer’s solicitors sent another facsimile pointing out that it did not seek to rely upon paragraph 15(e) of the new defence. Clearly, this could not prejudice Mr King. Indeed, it was to his benefit. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The matter came on for hearing before the magistrate at Dandenong on 6 July 2006. Application was made for leave to amend the defence in accordance with the document forwarded on 30 June 2006. After hearing submissions, the learned magistrate refused to grant leave. He delivered reasons. It will be necessary to refer to them later. <br /><strong>Judicial Review <br />11.</strong>&nbsp;The principles which a court applies in a judicial review are well established and I have discussed them in a number of cases. It is only necessary to refer to one of those cases. See <em>Sielawa v Secretary to the Department of Human Services and Anor</em>,[1] where the principles are exhaustively stated. It is unnecessary for me to repeat them. However, there are a number of matters that I need to emphasise.<br /><strong>12.&nbsp;</strong>There is no doubt that the common law jurisdiction of this Court to review decisions of inferior courts is exercisable in reviewing decisions of Magistrates’ Court. However, the jurisdiction is limited. It is supervisory and does not entitle this Court to canvass matters that it would on an appeal. The jurisdiction is different to an appeal. An appeal is the creature of statute. See <em>Fox v Percy</em>.[2] <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;On the other hand, the judicial review jurisdiction is a creature of the common law. The present jurisdiction is concerned with jurisdiction and the legality of what was done by the Magistrates’ Court and is not concerned with the merits of the decision under review. In particular, it is not concerned with whether the decision was fair or correct. Order 56 is concerned with procedure. It abolishes the remedies in the nature of the old prerogative writs, but nevertheless preserves the jurisdiction of this Court to make prerogative writ-type orders. The rules do not affect the common law jurisdiction of this Court. Equally, this Court has jurisdiction to make an order in the form similar to the old prerogative writ of <em>certiorari</em>, namely, quashing the decision under review. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The scope of the jurisdiction was exhaustively discussed by the High Court in <em>Craig v South Australia</em>[3] in respect to inferior courts and administrative tribunals, although that case was concerned with a statutory court in South Australia. The High Court[4] identified the most important and well-established grounds of review, namely, jurisdictional error, failing to observe some applicable requirement of procedural fairness, fraud, and error of law on the face of the record.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;When exercising this limited jurisdiction, this Court is not entitled to examine whether in fact the magistrate made the right decision or whether it was fair, just or reasonable, but is concerned instead with ensuring that he acted within jurisdiction and that in performing his decision making process, he complied with the law and took into account all relevant matters. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Craig’s case</em>, the High Court drew a distinction between tribunals and inferior courts. In that case,[5] the High Court defined some examples of jurisdictional error by an inferior statutory court, for example a Magistrates’ Court. Their Honours said:<br />"An inferior court falls into jurisdictional error if it mistakenly asserts or denies the existence of jurisdiction or if it misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers in a case where it correctly recognises a jurisdiction does exist. Such jurisdictional error can infect either a positive act or a refusal or a failure to act. Since certiorari goes only to quash a decision or order, an inferior court will fall into jurisdictional error for the purposes of the writ where it makes an order or decision (including an order or decision to the effect that it lacks, or refuses to exercise, jurisdiction) <u>which is based upon a mistaken assumption or denial of jurisdiction or a misconception or a disregard of the nature or limits of the jurisdiction.</u>" <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Their Honours then went on to give examples and observe that jurisdictional error will occur where the Court disregards or takes into account some matter in circumstances – <br />"... where the statute or other instrument establishing it and conferring its jurisdiction requires that a particular matter be taken into account or ignored as a pre-condition of the exercise of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of a particular case. Again an inferior court will exceed its authority and fall into jurisdictional error if it misconstrues that statute or other instrument <u>and thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case</u>. In the last mentioned category of case, the line between jurisdictional error and mere error in the exercise of jurisdiction may be particularly difficult to discern."[6] <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The magistrate’s decision refusing the application by the plaintiff for leave to file an amended defence is not at this stage open to appeal. Section 109 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 deals with an appeal to this Court from an order of the Magistrates’ Court. The right to appeal is on a question of law "from a final order of the Court".[7] <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;The decision made by the magistrate was not a final order. However, at the end of the proceeding, it would be open to the plaintiff, if it was unsuccessful in the proceeding below, to appeal the final order and in so doing raise the question of the magistrate’s refusal to permit the amendment. However, that would be a long way down the track. Although it would be relevant to a question of discretion in the present matter, it seems to me that it is appropriate to decide the issues raised which may have some bearing on the proceeding hereafter. In any event, at this stage this is the only avenue open to the plaintiff insurer. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;One other matter that has to be addressed at this stage, is what constitutes the record in a review where certiorari is sought to quash an order on the ground of error on the face of the record. The rules require, as did the common law, the production of that record. The general rule is that the record of an inferior court comprises the initiating document, pleadings if any, and the record of the Court evidencing the outcome. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;By reason of s10 of the <em>Administrative Law Act</em> 1978, the reasons for the decision form part of the record of the Magistrates’ Court. See <em>Thompson v Judge Byrne</em>;[8] and <em>RSL v Liquor Licensing Commission</em>.[9] In addition, a record may be expanded to include the transcript of the proceeding, if in fact it is incorporated into the record by reference. However, it must be an express incorporation. See <em>Craig’s case</em>.[10] <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;Although the transcript of the submissions were placed before this Court, there was no suggestion in the record that it has been incorporated and, in my view, it is not part of the record. If an attack is made on the basis that there is an error of law on the face of the record, this Court is restricted to that record and the decision will only be quashed if it is affected by an error of law which is disclosed on the face of that record. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Where the attack is made on grounds other than an error on the face of the record, then the Court can taken into account any relevant material placed before it, subject, of course, to the rules of evidence and procedure. See <em>R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw </em>per Denning LJ.[11] In that case, his Lordship stated that the parties could by agreement expand the record.<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Klempfner of counsel for the plaintiff referred the Court to a decision of Kaye J, where his Honour considered as part of the record the submissions made which led to the decision. However, it is clear from what his Honour said that his Honour proceeded on that basis because the parties had agreed to expand the record. In my opinion, I am restricted to looking at the complaint, the pleadings and the reasons, when considering the issue of error on the face of the record. When the ground is that the decision should be quashed on the ground of error on the face of the record, the Court is not confined to jurisdictional error. The principles were summarised by Professor Wade in his work <em>Administrative Law</em>,[12] where the learned author said:<br />"What must be emphasised here is that the High Court’s power to quash a decision merely because it displays some mistake in the record of its proceedings is an altogether exceptional power. It is exceptional because it is not a form of ‘jurisdictional’ control, ie. it is not a branch of the doctrine of ultra vires. A decision which is erroneous on its face, perhaps because it reveals some misinterpretation of the law, can be quashed even on the assumption that it is within jurisdiction and therefore involves no excess of power. All jurisdiction involves the power to make mistakes, provided they are made within the area of jurisdiction conferred. A mistake which appears on the face of the record, if it is held to involve no excess of jurisdiction, does not render a decision a nullity. The decision is intra vires, yet paradoxically the Court has power to quash it."<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;This is to be contrasted with an attack on the decision on the ground that it is the result of jurisdictional error. When such an attack is made, the jurisdiction is confined but the Court may look at all evidence before it in order to determine whether there is jurisdictional error. <br /><strong>The magistrate’s reasons <br />26.</strong>&nbsp;After hearing submissions, the magistrate delivered his reasons. It is apparent that he made a verbal error, which was drawn to his attention. He then gave further reasons correcting his earlier reasons. In my opinion, the reasons which form part of the record include the correction. It is necessary to state his reasons, which were:<br />HIS HONOUR: The application to adjourn is refused. In my view the prejudice, clearly the greater prejudice would be to Mr King if the matter was to be adjourned. With the greatest of respect the initial notice of defence made it blindingly obvious that the defendant was not satisfied with the particulars as the accident provided by Mr King. I think that is implicit in reading the defence, a querulous look, but if you look at the notice of defence it was filed by the defendant it clearly indicates that the defendants have some problem with the version of events given by the plaintiff, and surely at that time that is the time where the defendant should have raised all of the issues you now seek to raise.<br />MR BURCHILL: Sorry, I wasn’t sure whether Your Honour just said the adjournment application was refused or the application to amend was refused.<br />HIS HONOUR:&nbsp;No, the application to adjourn is refused, I’m sorry. The application to adjourn is refused.<br />MR KLEMPFNER: Sorry, we might be at cross purposes.<br />MR BURCHILL: Yes, I think we might be a bit, sorry, Your Honour. My understanding is that my learned friend’s application is to seek to amend the defence.<br />HIS HONOUR:&nbsp;Yes.<br />MR BURCHILL: If Your Honour accedes to that application - - -<br />HIS HONOUR:&nbsp;It necessarily follows. I am refusing the application to amend the defence.<br />MR BURCHILL: Sorry, yes. I thought Your Honour announced that you’re refusing to adjourn it and, sorry, I misunderstood what Your Honour was saying to me.<br />HIS HONOUR:&nbsp;I think I have not articulated it clearly enough. The application to amend the defence is refused. Again I go back to the reasons; it should have been blindingly obvious right from the start to the defendants, if they were going to call into issue the credibility of the version given by the plaintiff, it should have been raised at the time and not at the 11th hour. In my view the greater prejudice in allowing the amendment would clearly be to Mr King. So the application to amend is refused. Where do we go from there?<br /><strong>Grounds <br />27.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff, as it was bound to do, stated the grounds in support of its relief claimed in the originating motion that the decision should be quashed. In substance, it is alleged that the magistrate failed to take into account relevant considerations, that he took into account irrelevant considerations and that he misdirected himself as to the applicable principles. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;The starting point must be the statutory provision which the magistrate was obliged to apply. Order 35 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Civil Procedure Rules </em>1999 deals with a subject described as Miscellaneous Rules. Rule 35.02 deals with amendments. It provides:<br />"35.02 For the purpose of determining the real question in issue between the parties to any proceeding, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceeding, or of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, the Court may at any stage order that any document (including a complaint) in a proceeding be amended or that any party have leave to amend any document in the proceeding."<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;This rule is in exactly the same terms as Rule 36.01 of the <em>Supreme Court Rules</em>. It is important to emphasise that the Court may grant an amendment "at any stage", and that although the order is discretionary, the authorities show that in order to give effect to the opening words of the rule, as a general rule, amendments should be permitted unless prejudice is caused to a party which cannot be overcome by some suitable order. This is made very clear by what the High Court said in <em>Queensland v J.L. Holdings Pty Ltd.</em>[13<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;What their Honours said was to re-affirm a principle that goes back many years. I considered the cases in <em>McKenzie v Commonwealth of Australia</em>,[14] where at paragraph 31, I stated the principles in the following terms:<br />"As a general proposition, parties to litigation should be permitted, at any time, to amend their pleadings to raise bona fide and relevant matters, unless the amendment is likely to prejudice the other party, and the prejudice cannot be overcome. Justice in my view, demands amendment, unless the effect would be to cause an injustice to the other party."<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;It is clear that the magistrate considered the questions of prejudice to the parties and was of the view that the greater prejudice would be suffered by Mr King, as he put it: "if the matter was to be adjourned". But the question of the matter being adjourned, whilst relevant, nevertheless was not of great importance.<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;The magistrate stated that it must have been obvious, by reference to the notice of defence when first delivered, that the insurer was not satisfied with the information given by Mr King relating to the accident. He repeated that, by stating that the insurer had had some problem with the version of events given by Mr King. He stated that that is when the insurer, as defendant, should have raised all the issues. <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;At that stage, the magistrate was interrupted and was asked whether it was a question of whether an adjournment application was refused or whether the application to amend was refused. When the magistrate appreciated that he may not have not stated his reasons as intended, he did state that the application to amend the defence was refused. He repeated that it was obvious from the beginning that the defendant insurer raised an issue of the credibility of the version given by the plaintiff. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;The magistrate was of the view that the insurer should have raised the issue earlier and not at the eleventh hour. On the other hand, having stated that it was his view that the greater prejudice in allowing the amendment would be suffered by Mr King, he failed to identify precisely what that was. If one looks at the other part of the record, which was the original defence, it is clear that the magistrate misunderstood the defence which led him into error.<br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;The original defence asserted that Mr King was obliged, under the terms of the insurance contract, to co-operate when making a claim, and to co-operate with the insurer by providing it with information requested which was relevant to the claim. It was asserted that the insurer had requested a fully itemised telephone account, listing all mobile telephone calls made for the period 22 October 2005 to 26 October 2005. <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;It was then stated that until that information was provided, the insurer was not in a position to accept or deny the claim. The amended defence alleged that the claim made by Mr King was fraudulent, and one of the particulars asserted that he had claimed he had collapsed in an embankment pit after the collision and ‘came to’ much later with nobody around. It was further alleged in the proposed amended defence that he had been seen stepping into a motor vehicle about five minutes after the accident. <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;If those matters are proven, then it is fairly clear that the assertions made by him were inconsistent. It is said that he was acting fraudulently in making the claim that he did, taking into account matters that I have just stated. There is a well established principle that no lawyer should sign any pleading which alleges fraud unless there is a basis for it.<br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;It is fairly clear, by comparing the original defence and the proposed amended defence, that later information came into the knowledge of the plaintiff insurer which led to the proposed amended defence. It is clear from what the magistrate said that he had misunderstood the factual matters. This clearly infected all that he did. But more importantly, he failed to advert to the general principle permitting amendments, and based his decision upon the facts that the amendment should have been raised a lot earlier and that the insurer was guilty of delay. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;The rules of the Magistrates’ Court obliged the magistrate to permit an amendment to ensure that the real question in issue was raised between the parties, and also to avoid multiplicity of proceedings. It is clear that the magistrate failed to consider that rule or its effect. It is not a question of him misconstruing the obligation of the rule. He failed to give effect to it. <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;It is clear from what the magistrate said that he thought the question of delay was the only question. In my view, he misconceived the nature of the function which he was performing, namely, to decide whether or not leave should be granted in accordance with Rule 35.02, and in accordance with the well established principles that go back well in excess of 100 years. Any prejudice, if indeed there was any, could be overcome by an adjournment with costs, and, if thought appropriate, indemnity costs. He allowed the perceived delay to infect his consideration of the application. This was an error of law. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;It cannot be overlooked that Mr King’s advisors had six days in which to consider the new issues and to take instructions. His advisers could not have proceeded on the assumption that the application to amend would be denied and, accordingly, they would have been obliged to turn their mind to the new issues and to how they would contest them. Mr Burchill of counsel, who appeared on behalf of Mr King both in the Magistrates’ Court and before this Court, submitted that the magistrate properly exercised his jurisdiction and that it is not open on judicial review to quash the decision, if this Court disagreed with the result.<br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;Whilst I accept that the latter proposition of Mr Burchill, as a general proposition, is correct, I do not accept that the magistrate did exercise his jurisdiction in accordance with the law, for the reasons which I have stated. It follows that, in my opinion, the plaintiff has established an error of law on the face of the record and the decision made by the magistrate must be quashed. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;That now brings me to the question of what should happen. The proceeding in the Magistrates’ Court was adjourned pending the outcome of this judicial review. No doubt a new hearing date will be fixed and the matter will proceed. In the circumstances, I think the most appropriate order to make after quashing the decision is that the matter be remitted to the Magistrates’ Court, and that the application for leave to amend the defence should be considered in accordance with the law and these reasons.<br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;Subject to any submissions by counsel, I propose to make the following orders:<br />(i) That the Court dispense with the requirements of Rules 5.03(1) and 8.02 of the Rules of Court and authorise the plaintiff to commence a proceeding by originating motion in Form C; <br />(ii) That the Court hear and determine immediately the originating motion; <br />(iii) That the decision made by the magistrate, Mr Barrow, in the proceeding in the Magistrates’ Court at Dandenong on 6 July 2006 refusing the application for leave to file an amended defence, be quashed; <br />(iv) That the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria sitting at Dandenong consider the plaintiff’s application for leave to amend its defence in accordance with the law; <br />(v) That the first defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of this proceeding, including any reserved costs; <br />(vi) That the Court grant the first defendant, Mr Warwick Leigh King, an indemnity certificate under s4 of the <em>Appeal Costs Act </em>1998 in respect of the costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] (2003) VSC 140. <br />[2] (2003) 214 CLR 118. <br />[3] (1994) 184 CLR 163. <br />[4] At p176. <br />[5] At p177. <br />[6] Supra at p177. <br />[7] See s109(1). <br />[8] [1998] 2 VR 274 at 280. <br />[9] [1999] 2 VR 203 at 209. <br />[10] Supra at pp181-2. <br />[11] [1952] 1 KB 338 at 352-3. <br />[12] 6th ed. at p45. <br />[13] (1997) 189 CLR 146 at 155. <br />[14] [2001] VSC 361.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the plaintiff Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Ltd: Mr DA Klempfner, counsel.

The failure to comply with the duty of utmost good faith does not mean that the claim is fraudulent. In all cases where a fraudulent claim is made, one can readily infer a breach of the obligation of utmost good faith. But it does not follow that a breach of the utmost good faith obligation means that the claim made is fraudulent. It must depend upon all the circumstances.<br />3.&nbsp;The insurer had a heavy burden in this case to establish that by an omission to state certain matters, the insured had misrepresented a fact of substance to the claim. The omission to reveal these facts did not represent any false statement to the insurer. The dishonest intention required for fraud is at least one to induce a false belief in the insurer for the purpose of obtaining payment or some other benefit under the policy. Fraud which relates to the claim made with that intent will disentitle the claimant.<br />4.&nbsp;The omissions to state the information did not induce a false belief in the insurer in relation to any relevant matter for its consideration. It did not accept H. was driving. It did not accept his version of the circumstances of the incident. The omission to reveal the information, even done deliberately, did not create any false belief in the insurer which in any way improved H.''s prospects in respect of the claim. The claim was not made fraudulently. Further, H. did not, even though he deliberately withheld the information, do so with an intention of obtaining payment or some other benefit under the policy. Accordingly, it was open to the magistrate to find that H.''s claim was not a fraudulent claim.<br /><br />GILLARD J:</strong><br /><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;This is an appeal by an insurer against orders made by a Magistrates’ Court that the insurer pay an insured the sum of $25,000 pursuant to a motor vehicle policy.<br /><strong>Parties <br />2.&nbsp;</strong>The appellant, Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Ltd (“the insurer”) is an insurer and insures motor vehicles at the request of the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria. It was the defendant in the Magistrates’ Court proceeding.<br /><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>The respondent, Christopher Heron (“the insured”), was at all relevant times a carpenter and the owner of a 2002 Ford Falcon AU motor vehicle registered number SAK 772 (“the vehicle”). The insured was the plaintiff in the proceeding in the Magistrates’ Court. <br /><strong>Magistrates’ Court proceeding <br />4.&nbsp;</strong>On 4 August 2004, the insured filed a complaint in the Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne. He sought damages from the insurer for the latter’s breach of a contract of insurance.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;The basic facts concerning the claim were not in dispute and can be briefly stated. The insured sought an insurance policy over his vehicle from the RACV which resulted in a policy being issued by the insurer. On the morning of 27 March 2004, at approximately 4.30am, the vehicle rolled over in Coolart Road, Hastings and suffered substantial damage resulting in it being written off (“the incident”). The insured stated that he was the driver at the relevant time. The parties agreed that the market value of the vehicle was $25,000. Later that day, the insured lodged a claim with the insurer seeking indemnity in respect of the damage caused to his vehicle. The claim was investigated and the insurer refused the claim.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The insurer filed a defence to the claim on 2 September 2004. It admitted that the plaintiff was the owner of the vehicle, that it was covered by a contract of insurance with it, and that a claim had been made. However, it did not admit that the vehicle was involved in a collision. Further, it denied that the insured suffered any loss or damage. The insurer also raised a number of defences. The insurer alleged that a term of the policy entitled it to refuse to pay a claim if the insured was not truthful and frank in any statement made in a claim or in connection with a claim. It further alleged that the insured was not truthful and frank in statements made in the claim or in connection with it.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The particulars of the allegation were extremely general. The particulars alleged that the insured, or alternatively Leon Murphy, made false statements to the insurer regarding the circumstances surrounding the accident, misled the insurer with respect to the said circumstances, and made statements which they knew or ought reasonably to have known or did not care would cause the insurer to be misled regarding the said circumstances. The alleged false statements and misleading conduct were not identified.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Further, and in the alternative, the insurer alleged that the insured owed it a duty to act towards it with the utmost good faith and that there had been a breach of that duty. The particulars of the alleged breach of utmost good faith repeated the particulars which were sub-joined to the allegation that the claim was not truthful and frank. Further, and in the alternative, it was pleaded that the insurer could refuse a claim if the incident which resulted in the claim occurred because the person driving the vehicle was under the influence of alcohol. It asserted that either Mr Heron or Leon Murphy was driving the vehicle at the time of the incident whilst under the influence of alcohol. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The proceeding came on for hearing before a magistrate on 28 February 2005 and was heard over three days. Application was made by counsel on behalf of the insured to split the case on the basis that the insurer carried the burden of proof. The learned magistrate acceded to the application and the insurer was required to present its case first. It was accepted by the Court after submission by counsel for the insured, that the defence alleged the false statement was a plea of fraudulent claim. The learned magistrate reserved her decision on 11 April 2005 and delivered it on 6 May 2005.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The magistrate found as a fact that the insured was driving at the relevant time and not Mr Murphy. The defence that the driver at the time of the incident was under the influence of alcohol, failed. The real contest concerned the alleged failure by the insured to be truthful and frank in relation to statements he made in the claim. The parties and the magistrate proceeded on the basis that a term in the policy booklet was in effect an obligation of good faith imposed on the insured and that s13 of the <em>Insurance Contracts Act </em>1984 (“the Act”) applied to the contract of insurance. The particulars sub-joined to paragraph 11 of the defence relied upon in relation to the alleged breach of the duty to act towards the insurer with the utmost good faith, asserted that the insured made false statements regarding the circumstances surrounding the incident that caused the damage. The defence was not properly pleaded. It did not identify with any particularity the circumstances relied upon which allegedly constituted a failure by Mr Heron to honour his obligation of utmost good faith as required by s13 of the Act. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;As appears from Her Honour’s reasons, the contentions put by the insurer at trial constituting the breach of the duty of utmost good faith, were that Mr Heron in his claim withheld information in relation to “(1) Leon Murphy’s breath test and; (2) information regarding a telephone call to Rosebud Police Station.”[1] In order to understand these contentions, it is necessary to state further facts. It appeared that some hours earlier on the night in question, Mr Leon Murphy had been driving the motor vehicle, and had been apprehended by the police and charged with driving whilst his blood alcohol content exceeded .05%. Some hours after Mr Murphy was apprehended, he rang the insured, informed him of what had happened, and requested that the insured come and collect the car and him. The insured did so and the incident occurred when he was driving back with Mr Murphy, who was the passenger. The second matter concerns a telephone call between Mr Heron and a Senior Constable Young, which occurred on the day of the incident at about 1.00pm. Mr Heron told the senior constable that he was unaware of where his car was. <br />12.&nbsp;The learned magistrate found that Mr Heron was in breach of the obligation of utmost good faith. She made the following findings:<br />(i) That the insured’s failure to advise the insurer of the conversation he had with a member of the police concerning the whereabouts of his vehicle was dishonest.[2] <br />(ii) That the insured’s failure to advise the insurer of the circumstances surrounding his presence in Coolart Road at 4.30am, namely, that it was because of Mr Murphy’s involvement with the police earlier that night, was a conscious decision and the omission was dishonest.[3<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;What is meant by the word “dishonest” in the context of the learned magistrate’s reasons can be determined by reference to what Her Honour said earlier. She stated[4] that there was not a breach of the duty of utmost good faith where there was an omission to disclose, “unless there is dishonesty”. She referred to the New Zealand decision of <em>Vermeulen v S.I.M.U. Mutual Insurance Association</em>.[5] In that case, Hardie Boys J[6] noted that the duty extends beyond the making of a claim which the insured knew was false because there would be no need for the duty if that is prohibited. Having observed that it was his opinion that a breach involved one of dishonesty, His Honour then said:<br />“An intention to deceive the insurer may not be necessary (<em>Sampson v Goldstar Insurance Co Ltd </em>(1980) NZLR 742) but what is necessary is an honest disclosure of all material facts. The converse of this, which may be the better way of expressing it in view of the onus of proof, is that non-disclosure or error does not amount to a breach of the duty unless there is dishonesty.”<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;It is noted that an intention to deceive may not be necessary. In other words, a breach of the duty of utmost good faith may involve dishonesty which does not include an intention to deceive the insurer.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;The learned magistrate, having made the findings she did, stated the following:<br />“To the extent that I found that the plaintiff dishonestly withheld information relevant to the insurer’s decision whether to indemnify or deny liability this amounts to a breach of utmost good faith pursuant to s13 of the <em>Insurance Contract Act</em>, and s54 provides the appropriate remedy ... ". <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;Given those findings it is apparent that the learned magistrate used the word “dishonest” as meaning that the insured deliberately omitted to provide information which was relevant to the insurer’s decision whether to indemnify or deny liability.<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;I note that neither of the matters of dishonest omission amounting to an allegation of fraud were alleged in the defence. They should have been particularised. They should have been identified.<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The magistrate then referred to s54 of the Act. It deals with the situation where the effect of a contract of insurance would be that the insurer may refuse to pay the claim because of some act of the insured, and provides in s54(1) – <br />“ ... the insurer may not refuse to pay the claim by reason only of that act but his liability in respect of the claim is reduced by the amount that fairly represents the extent to which the insurer’s interests were prejudiced as a result of that act.”<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;The learned magistrate referred to the decision of <em>Entwills Pty Ltd v National and General Insurance Co Limited</em>[7] and concluded that there was no evidence of prejudice suffered by the insurer and hence the insured’s breach of his obligation of good faith did not enable the insurer to resist his claim for indemnity. Accordingly, s54(1) applied and although the insurer had established the defence, it did not prove any prejudice and accordingly was obliged to pay the indemnity. Those findings made by the learned magistrate are not the subject of this appeal and I need say no more about them.<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Paragraph 10 of the defence, as I have stated, asserted that the insurer was entitled to refuse a claim if the insured was not truthful and frank in any statement made in a claim or connection with it. It was asserted that the term was express and was contained in the policy booklet. Paragraph 11 asserted a breach of that term and the particulars sub-joined, as I have already stated, assert that the insured made false statements and misled the insurer regarding the circumstances surrounding the incident. At trial, the parties accepted that this was an allegation of a fraudulent claim. The policy booklet contains the following:<br />“We may refuse a claim ... , if: <br />• you are not truthful and frank in any statement you make in a claim or in connection with a claim.”<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;An allegation of a fraudulent claim is indeed serious and should have been pleaded with sufficient particulars to understand in what way the claim was a fraudulent one. The allegation is based upon s56 of the Act. It is the magistrate’s findings in relation to this defence which are the subject of the appeal. The magistrate said little in respect to this defence and I will set out hereafter what she said. Her Honour stated that she did not find that fraud had been committed by the insured. It was common ground that it was a serious allegation, and that the insurer carried the burden of proof in accordance with the Briginshaw standard of proof.[8] <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;As stated, the defence was inadequate in a number of respects. It did not properly identify the alleged breaches of the duty of utmost good faith, nor did it properly plead the defence of alleged fraud. In my opinion it is essential that the pleadings set out the proper issues, especially where there is a serious allegation such as fraud, and identify them so there is no dispute as to what is in issue between the parties at trial. It is very apparent from what the learned magistrate said that she thought that the defence of a fraudulent claim was a side wind and of little importance. Hence the paucity of the reasons for rejecting the defence. Neither party has sought to appeal the inadequacy of the reasons given by the learned magistrate. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;The magistrate ordered that the insurer pay damages in the sum of $25,000. She ordered that interest pursuant to s57 of the Act should run from 6 May 2005 and not earlier, and further ordered that each party should bear their own costs. The reasoning in relation to the orders made with respect to interest and costs is somewhat difficult to accept. The insured was successful in his claim. The magistrate found that the insurer was not acting unreasonably in withholding payment and hence ordered that interest should run from the date of the judgment. She went on to state “for similar reasons I order that each party bear their own costs in these proceedings”. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;The insured did not complete a claim form. In accordance with the modern practice, he was interviewed by an investigator some 13 days after the event, during which he gave a long statement which was recorded, printed and signed by him. He stated categorically that he was the driver at the relevant time. The magistrate took the view that the insured’s failure to refer to the fact that Mr Murphy had earlier driven the car whilst under the influence of liquor, and failure to tell the investigator that when he spoke to the police he stated he did not know where his car was, entitled the insurance company to refuse indemnity, but that nevertheless s54 entitled the insured to recover his loss. From a very early stage, the insurance company investigated the claim and formed a certain view as to the honesty of the insured. The insurer had grave doubts about the insured’s statement that he was the driver. As things turned out these doubts were misplaced. Whether or not the insured had in fact disclosed what he should have disclosed, according to the magistrate would not have made any difference. The insurer was extremely suspicious as to who was driving at the relevant time and even if the insured had revealed the matters which the magistrate held he ought to reveal, in my view the same result would have followed; a refusal of indemnity. I must say that I am somewhat surprised by the order made by the magistrate with respect to costs. The insurer failed to establish the defences pleaded by it. The very generality of the particulars of false statements suggests that the insurer was unsure about its defence relating to such false or misleading statements. In fact what was found by the learned magistrate was an omission to disclose relevant information. No appeal has been brought in respect to these findings. <br /><strong>Appeal <br />25.</strong>&nbsp;In accordance with the new procedure, the appeal is instituted by the filing of a notice of appeal.[9] In accordance with the Rules the notice must set out the questions of law and the grounds of appeal.<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;The questions of law were expressed as follows:<br />“1. Whether the learned magistrate, having found that the respondent –<br />(a) consciously and deliberately withheld information from the appellant concerning Mr Leon Murphy having received an infringement notice for driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration level of 0.11% but less than 0.12% on 27 March 2004; <br />(b) dishonestly failed to advise the appellant that he had claimed to have no knowledge of the whereabouts of his motor vehicle during his conversation with Senior Constable Young of Victoria Police on 27 March 2004; <br />(c) erred in law in concluding that the plaintiff’s claim on the relevant policy of insurance was not fraudulently made within the meaning of s56(1) of the <em>Insurance Contracts Act </em>1984 (Cth).<br />2. Whether the learned magistrate having found that the respondent –<br />(a) [same as above];<br />(b) [same as above]<br />erred in law in failing to conclude that the plaintiff had thereby knowingly made a false statement to the appellant in connection with an insurance claim for the purpose of inducing the appellant to meet the claim thereby rendering the respondent’s claim fraudulently made within the meaning of s56(1) of the <em>Insurance Contracts Act </em>1984 (Cth).<br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;The grounds of appeal are similarly expressed. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant insurer sought orders that the appeal be allowed and that the insured’s claim be dismissed, that judgment be entered for the insurer and that the insured pay the appellant’s costs of the proceeding and the appeal. <strong>Magistrate’s Reasons <br />29.</strong>&nbsp;As earlier stated, the defence of a fraudulent claim does not appear to have been central to the issues in the proceeding. Very early in her judgment, the magistrate said:<br />“The defendant seeks to avoid payment of the claim on the grounds that the insured had breached it (sic) duty of utmost good faith and <u>also possibly</u> made a fraudulent claim.” <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;Her Honour’s reasons concerning the defence were – <br />“In conclusion, I consider it appropriate to further address the issue of fraud, but do not intend to, in any great detail, having regard to my findings of breach of duty of utmost good faith. It was the plaintiff that alleged that paragraph 11(3) of the defence amounts to an allegation of fraud. I supported such an interpretation when I so ordered that the case be split. I refer again to the case of <em>Protean v American Home Insurance </em>and particularly at p234 where Fullagar J states that it is necessary to bear in mind the gravity of the allegation, and again refers to the High Court case of <em>Briginshaw v Briginshaw </em>and in particular I refer to Dixon J’s observations of the critical considerations before such a finding should be made. <br />Just in conclusion I will just read those observations. ‘The seriousness of an allegation made in inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description of the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding, are considerations which must effect the answer to the question, whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters reasonable satisfaction should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony or indirect inferences. Everyone must feel that when, for instance, the issues on which of two dates an admitted occurrence took place, a satisfactory conclusion may be reached on materials of a kind that would not satisfy any sound or prudent judgment if the question was whether some act had been done involving grave moral delinquency.’ In short, I do not find that a fraud has been committed by the plaintiff. <br />I am sorry that was a bit lengthy, but are my findings clear.”<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;It can be seen that the magistrate failed to explain why it was that she found that fraud had not been committed by Mr Heron in making the claim. Neither party has sought to appeal against the inadequacy of the reasons given. The authorities make it clear that a judicial officer in delivering a decision must give sufficient reasons to enable both the parties and an appellate court to ascertain the reasoning upon which the decision was based. See <em>Sun Alliance Insurance Ltd v Massoud</em>.[10]<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Whilst the magistrate did not explain her reasoning in concluding that the insured had not committed fraud in making his claim, her reasons provide some indication of her reasoning. In my view, taking into account the reference by the magistrate to an authority, and quoting what Dixon J stated in <em>Briginshaw</em>, it seems to me that the reasons why she found that a fraud had not been committed by the insured were because although she had made the findings she did, she was not persuaded that the insured intended to deceive the insurer by his omission and the insurer had failed to establish the defence. Her Honour referred to the Court of Appeal decision of <em>To v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd.</em>[11] I put to counsel on the appeal that one should read the learned magistrate’s reasons in that way, namely, that the finding that fraud was not established was because it had not been established by the insured, that the insured intended to deceive the insurer to gain an advantage by omitting to state the matters that the learned magistrate considered were relevant and in breach of his duty of utmost good faith. <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;Earlier in Her Honour’s reasons for judgment, when talking about the duty of utmost good faith and s54 of the Act, and having observed that there was a non-disclosure concerning Mr Murphy and the phone call to the Rosebud Police, the magistrate posed the question whether the non-disclosure and false statements were made with the intention of deceiving the insurer. She then said:<br />“For these purposes I refer to the matter of <em>To </em>to which I was referred, and in particular to Buchanan JA where he states at 285 (sic) of that decision: <br />‘The mental element required to establish fraud is an intention to deceive, that is an intention to create a false belief in a person deceived for the purpose of obtaining money or some other benefit.”<br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;The learned magistrate then went on to consider whether the failure to disclose amounted to a breach of the duty of utmost good faith, and asserted that to prove that there must be dishonesty. <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel did not demur from my observations as to what I thought was the learned magistrate’s reasoning for rejecting the defence of a fraudulent claim. <br /><strong>Question of law <br />36.</strong>&nbsp;By reason of s109 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 a party to a civil proceeding may only appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law. As a general proposition, a finding of fact made by a magistrate does not involve a question of law. It is emphasised that that is a general proposition which will, of course, depend upon whether there is any evidence to support the finding. The learned magistrate made certain findings of fact, and then had to determine whether or not those findings led to the conclusion that the claim was made fraudulently within the meaning of s56(1) of the Act. She held that the insured had not committed fraud. <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;The submission put on behalf of the insurer by Mr H. Austin of counsel was that, having made her findings of deliberate and dishonest omissions by the insured to provide relevant information to the insurer, namely, that Mr Murphy had earlier driven the motor vehicle with a blood alcohol reading in excess of .05 and that the following day the insured had told the police that he did not know where his vehicle was, the magistrate was bound to find that the claim was fraudulent within the meaning of s56(1) of the Act. His submission was that, having made the findings in relation to the breach of the duty of utmost good faith, the magistrate in fulfilling her fact finding role was bound to hold that the claim was a fraudulent one within the meaning of s56 of the Act. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;The task that confronted the magistrate, having found that there had been a breach of the duty of utmost good faith although not giving the insurer the right to refuse the claim, was to consider and determine whether the insurer had proven that the claim was a fraudulent one. Her Honour had earlier referred to what Buchanan JA said in the To case. There is no suggestion by counsel for the insurer that the magistrate misdirected herself on a question of law. It follows that the argument is that in her fact finding role the magistrate was in error. To make good this contention, it was necessary for the insurer on this appeal to show that having made the findings Her Honour did concerning utmost good faith, there was no finding open other than that there had been a fraudulent claim. In other words, the magistrate was bound to reach that result because of those findings, and her failure to do so was perverse. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>To v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd,</em>[12] the insured made a claim under a motor vehicle policy. Her 15 year old son had driven her vehicle without her consent and damaged it. The insured mistakenly believed that the policy would not cover the damage and when she made the claim she falsely stated that the vehicle had been stolen and damaged. This was obviously a false claim. It was contended on behalf of the insured that although she had falsely stated the circumstances leading to the damage, nevertheless if she had told the truth she would have been entitled to recover in any event. The magistrate at first instance agreed, but it was reversed on appeal by a single judge of this Court and the latter’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. On appeal, Buchanan JA wrote the leading judgment. His Honour considered statements made in the cases as to what constituted fraud and considered the mental element required. His Honour said:[13]<br />“In my view the mental element required to establish fraud is <u>an intention to deceive</u>, that is, an intention to create a false belief in the person deceived <u>for the purpose of obtaining money or some other benefit</u>. It is not necessary to go further and stipulate knowledge or belief as to a lack of entitlement to the money or other benefit claimed.” <br />(Emphases added).<br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour, noting that a false statement made fraudulently within the meaning of s56(1) of the Act is one made knowingly in connection with a claim for the purpose of inducing an insurer to meet the claim, observed:[14]<br />“For the reasons set out above, I consider that the existence of an underlying valid claim does not render fraud irrelevant; <u>the dishonest intention required for fraud is at least</u> one to <u>induce a false belief</u> in the insurer for the <u>purpose of obtaining payment or some other benefit under the policy</u>, with or without belief or knowledge of a lack of entitlement; and fraud which relates to the claim made with the requisite intent will disentitle the claimant even if made subsequent to the first presentation of the claim.” <br />(Emphases added).<br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour’s observations were made in the context of the facts in that case and his statements of what constitutes a fraudulent claim cannot be said to be an exhaustive definition. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;At first instance, Mandie J referred to what Lord Coleridge CJ said in his charge to a jury in <em>Norton v Royal Fire and Life Assurance Co.</em>[15] His Lordship stated that:<br />“ ... He had left to the jury whether it was fraudulent in the sense of an intention to deceive and defraud the company by getting out of them money he knew he had no right to ... ".<br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;Mandie J added the words “or believe” after the word “knew”. <br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;In Norton’s case, the insured admitted at trial before the jury that he had exaggerated the amount of his loss because he had been advised to inflate the claim because insurance companies never allowed the full claim and always cut it down. It appears before the proceeding was instituted, that the plaintiff in fact reduced the amount of the claim. The learned trial judge left the question to the jury saying:<br />“I have already said that it is not a false claim if all the articles were there merely because too high a value was placed upon them; but you must look at the whole conduct of the plaintiff, and say whether it was a fraudulent claim.”<br /><strong>45.</strong>&nbsp;The jury found for the plaintiff. Application was then made to the Queen’s Bench Division on behalf of the insurer for a new trial and Lord Coleridge CJ and Cave J upheld the judgment in favour of the plaintiff. Lord Coleridge CJ emphasised that it was a question of fact for the jury. <br /><strong>46.</strong>&nbsp;The matter went on appeal and the appeal court set aside the verdict and judgment on the ground that the verdict was unsatisfactory because the view of the evidence that the plaintiff knowingly made a false statement in order that the company might act upon it was not properly left to the jury.[16]<br /><strong>47.</strong>&nbsp;In considering whether a claim is made fraudulently, the starting point must be the terms of the contract of insurance. In seeking to determine what might be described as the common law meaning of “a fraudulent claim” in the authorities, it is necessary to ascertain whether the particular case was dealing with a clause in a contract of insurance. Sometimes the term of the contract reveals what is meant by, and the effect of, a fraudulent claim. As stated, the policy booklet which constitutes the contract of insurance in the present matter provides very little assistance as to what is meant by a fraudulent claim. No doubt this has come about because of the presence of s56 of the Act. It follows therefore that in determining what is a fraudulent claim, the principles laid down in the cases must be considered. But in considering the cases, it is necessary to see whether they dealt with a particular clause which provides a definition of a “fraudulent claim”.<br /><strong>48.</strong>&nbsp;The Act does not contain a definition of the phrase “fraudulent claim”. The cases provide examples of fraudulent claims. The classic example of a fraudulent claim is where an insured intentionally misstates a fact with an intention of obtaining payment under a policy to which the insured is not entitled. If an insured makes a claim when no loss has been suffered within the terms of the policy then the claim is a fraudulent one. See <em>Phillips v Chapman</em>[17] where a claim was made for loss arising from a burglary which had not taken place. In <em>Thompson v Hopper</em>[18] the insured suffered a loss but it was not caused by the peril insured against. In that case a vessel was sent to sea in an unfit condition which increased the danger which ultimately led to her loss. See also <em>Fire and All Risks Insurance Company v Powell.</em>[19] <br /><strong>49.</strong>&nbsp;Often claims are made which are inflated. Sometimes the insured is not guilty of dishonest conduct. For example, there may be an honest overestimate, or a mistake may be made. It cannot be overlooked in this regard that the value of a loss is often an expression of opinion. In those circumstances the claim may not be fraudulent, but if it is shown that the insured intended to defraud the insurers, then the claim is fraudulent. Intention to defraud may be inferred because the over-estimate is excessive.<br /><strong>50.&nbsp;</strong>Fraudulent claims may be made in a variety of ways, but they all have at least three common features. First, by reason of the conduct of the insured or another on his behalf, whether it be act or omission, the insured represents to the insurer a fact or facts, which is or which are false. This may also result because of circumstances over which the insured has some control, where a representation is made which is false and which the insured, knowing the insurer is labouring under a false belief, does nothing to correct it. Secondly, the false fact is relevant to whether the insured will accept or reject the claim. Thirdly, the insured is induced to form a mistaken belief about some aspect of the claim. <br /><strong>51.</strong>&nbsp;The defence asserted that the insured or alternatively his friend Mr Murphy made false statements or misled the insurer regarding the circumstances surrounding the accident. The findings made by the learned magistrate were that the insured dishonestly omitted to reveal certain information. The omission to reveal the information did not represent any false fact to the insurer. On the other hand, the dishonest failure to reveal relevant information to a claim may constitute fraud in the circumstances. But whether or not it does will depend upon whether or not it is proven that it was done with an intention to deceive. <br /><strong>52.</strong>&nbsp;It is well settled that a false representation may be made intentionally or recklessly not caring whether it be true or false, Lord Herschell in <em>Derry v Peek </em>wrote:[20]<br />“ ... Fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation is being made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states.”<br /><strong>53.</strong>&nbsp;Further, a false representation may be made even though the insured has not made any false statement but in the circumstances has knowingly created a false belief. An insured cannot ignore the obvious in making statements or representations, or use the Lord Nelson principle of “turning a blind eye”. An insured is bound to make enquiries to ascertain the true position in making a claim. The doctrine of utmost good faith ensures that this is so. As stated, the literal truth may in certain circumstances create a false representation of fact which is known to the insured. The insured has a duty to disabuse the insurer of any fact relevant to the consideration of the claim and its determination. The latter involves at least two important decisions, first, acceptance of the claim and secondly, the quantum of the claim. <br /><strong>54.</strong>&nbsp;Unlike other areas of the law, the insurer does not have to act upon the represented fact or facts and suffer damage before it may refuse a fraudulent claim. The approach in insurance law is different and is bound up with the duty to observe the utmost good faith in dealings with an insurer throughout, including the making of a claim. The principle stated by Lord Halsbury in <em>Derry v Peek</em>[21] does not apply. His Lordship said in a case where it was alleged that false representations were made in a prospectus by the directors of the company:<br />“To quote the language now some centuries old in dealing with actions of this character, ‘fraud without damage or damage without fraud’ does not give rise to such actions.”<br /><strong>55.</strong>&nbsp;The approach in the law of insurance is different. In <em>Britton v The Royal Insurance Company</em>,[22] Wills J said:[23]<br />“The law upon such a case is in accordance with justice, and also with sound policy. The law is, that a person who has made a fraudulent claim could not be permitted to recover at all. The contract of insurance is one of perfect good faith on both sides, and it is most important that such good faith should be maintained. It is the common practice to insert in fire policies conditions that they shall be void in the event of a fraudulent claim; and there was such a condition in the present case. Such a condition is only in accordance with legal principle and sound policy. It would be most dangerous to permit parties to practise such fraud, and then, notwithstanding their falsehood and fraud, to recover the real value of the goods consumed. And if there is wilful falsehood and fraud in the claim, the insured forfeits all claim whatever upon the policy.”<br /><strong>56.</strong>&nbsp;In that case the insured fraudulently exaggerated the amount of the loss. The common law adopted a very strict approach to the question, requiring the utmost good faith in making a claim, and the mere fact that the insurer was not induced to act to its detriment and hence suffer loss was of no consequence. As Buchanan JA said in the <em>To</em> case:[24]<br />“The courts’ attitude to fraudulent claims was a manifestation of the fundamental principle of insurance law that the utmost good faith must be observed by each party, the importance of which has often been emphasised.”<br /><strong>57.</strong>&nbsp;The decision in the To case demonstrates that the insurer need not prove that it suffered any loss as a result of the fraudulent claim. The philosophy of the law is to discourage the making of fraudulent claims. It has been the law for hundreds of years and is still the law. Lord Hobhouse in <em>The Star Sea</em>[25] said:<br />“The fraudulent insured must not be allowed to think: if the fraud is successful, then I will gain; if it is unsuccessful I will lose nothing.”<br /><strong>58.</strong>&nbsp;The 1984 Act deals with fraudulent claims in s56. Section 56(3) underlines the importance of the philosophy of the law of deterring fraudulent conduct. Section 56 alters the common law in that in certain circumstances the Court may order the insurer to pay even though the claim was made fraudulently. However, the alteration to the law is confined and the Court may order an insurer to pay “if only a minimal or insignificant part of the claim is made fraudulently and non-payment of the remainder of the claim would be harsh and unfair.”<br /><strong>59.</strong>&nbsp;The question whether a claim is fraudulent or not is a factual one for the tribunal of fact, whether it be a judicial officer or a jury.[26] Pollock CB in charging the jury said:<br />“But the question is, whether the claim was fraudulent, i.e., whether it was wilfully false in any substantial respect. The case concerned a fire policy and the question did arise as to the value of furniture.”<br /><strong>60.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, to allege that a claim is made fraudulently is indeed a serious allegation, and although the insurer has the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities, nevertheless it is the standard laid down in <em>Briginshaw v Briginshaw</em>.[27]<br /><strong>61.</strong>&nbsp;It bears repeating what Dixon J said:[28]<br />“The truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. No doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty; and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. ... Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, <u>it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal</u>. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. <u>The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal</u>. In such matters ‘reasonable satisfaction’ should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony or indirect inferences.” <br />(Emphases added).<br /><strong>62.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour went on to quote a number of <em>dicta </em>and observed:[29]<br />“It means that the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained. When, in a civil proceeding, a question arises whether a crime has been committed, the standard of persuasion is, according to the better opinion, the same as upon other civil issues ... But consistently with this opinion, weight is given to the presumption of innocence and <u>an exactness of proof is expected</u>.” <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>63.</strong>&nbsp;In the present proceeding, the learned magistrate observed that the burden rested upon the insurer, and referred to what was said by Sir Owen Dixon in <em>Briginshaw’s </em>case. The magistrate also referred to what Buchanan JA said in <em>To’s </em>case as to what was meant by a fraudulent claim. There is no doubt that a finding of fact can constitute an error of law where it is established that on the evidence, the Court could not reasonably have reached the conclusion that it reached.[30] The learned magistrate found as a fact that the claim was not fraudulent. The magistrate’s decision is to be treated as a finding of fact by a jury. The test was stated by Herring CJ in <em>Young v Paddle Bros Pty Ltd</em>[31] where his Honour said:<br />“The principle that has to be applied is that applicable to the verdict of the jury. ... If on any reasonable view of the evidence that decision can be supported, then the party who complains of that decision cannot have it set aside and the contrary decision that he desires substituted for it. It is a question of what he is entitled to as a matter of law, and he is only entitled to a contrary decision when that decision is the only possible decision that the evidence on any reasonable view can support.”[32]<br /><strong>64.</strong>&nbsp;Stephen J (as he then was) said:[33]<br />“ ... in the case of any question of fact the Court should treat the matter as an appeal from the verdict of a jury and should not make up its own mind upon the evidence but rather confine itself to seeing whether there was evidence upon which the magistrate might, as a reasonable man, come to the conclusion to which he did.”<br /><strong>65.</strong>&nbsp;The insurer submits on this appeal, that having made the finding she did on the breach of the obligation of utmost good faith, the learned magistrate was bound to find that it was a fraudulent claim. In other words, no other conclusion was open to Her Honour having made those findings on the primary facts. <br /><strong>66.</strong>&nbsp;Although the principle of utmost good faith is invariably linked with a fraudulent claim, nevertheless they are two different concepts. The failure to comply with the duty of utmost good faith does not mean that the claim is fraudulent. In all cases where a fraudulent claim is made, one can readily infer a breach of the obligation of utmost good faith. But it does not follow that a breach of the utmost good faith obligation means that the claim made is fraudulent. It must depend upon all the circumstances.<br /><strong>67.</strong>&nbsp;The insured made a claim under the policy. The claim was that he was the driver at the relevant time and his vehicle suffered damage. It is clear that the insured did not make a false statement concerning the identity of the driver or the fact of damage to his vehicle. He did not make any false statement about his state of sobriety or otherwise. He did not complete a claim form but, in accordance with the insurer’s practice, was interviewed at length by an investigator and signed a long, detailed statement prepared during the interview. He did not make a false statement in the signed record. He failed, according to the reasons of the learned magistrate, to disclose two pieces of information and the learned magistrate held that he had dishonestly withheld the information. The learned magistrate held that he should have revealed these facts to the insurer and that he was dishonest in failing to do so. <br /><strong>68.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, the insured did not represent a false fact to the insurer which in any way affected its consideration of the claim. There was no fraudulent misstatement of fact or representation of a false fact by conduct. Applying the principles of law stated by Buchanan JA concerning the mental element, namely, an intention “to create a false belief in the person deceived for the purpose of obtaining money or some other benefit”, it was clearly open to the magistrate to conclude that the insurer had failed to prove that intention. Applying what His Honour later said in the judgment:[34] “The dishonest intention required for fraud is at least one to induce a false belief in the insurer for the purpose of obtaining payment or some other benefit under the policy”, it was clearly open to the magistrate to come to the conclusion that there was no dishonest intention to induce a false belief in the insurer. Further, it is clear from Her Honour’s reference to the New Zealand case that the breach of the obligation of utmost good faith does not necessarily involve an intention to deceive. In my opinion the learned magistrate had this in mind when reaching her decision that the insurer had not proven that the insured made a fraudulent claim. <br /><strong>69.</strong>&nbsp;The insurer fails because in my opinion it was open to the learned magistrate to conclude as a question of fact that although there had been an omission to reveal two pieces of information, the omission did not constitute a fraudulent claim. <br /><strong>70.</strong>&nbsp;It is not to the point on this appeal whether this Court would have come to the same conclusion. However, as the learned magistrate’s reasons were sparse to say the least, it is appropriate to briefly state my views. <br /><strong>71.</strong>&nbsp;The insurer had a heavy burden in this case to establish that by an omission to state certain matters, the insured had misrepresented a fact of substance to the claim. The omission to reveal these facts did not represent any false statement to the insurer. <br /><strong>72.</strong>&nbsp;As Buchanan JA said in the <em>To </em>case, “The dishonest intention required for fraud is at least one to induce a false belief in the insurer for the purpose of obtaining payment or some other benefit under the policy”. Fraud which relates to the claim made with that intent will disentitle the claimant.<br /><strong>73.</strong>&nbsp;The claim throughout was that the insured was driving the vehicle when it suffered the damage. The insurer put that question in issue. But the insured did not represent anything to the contrary. The omissions to state the information which the magistrate said should have been revealed, did not induce a false belief in the insurer in relation to any relevant matter for its consideration. It did not accept he was driving. It did not accept his version of the circumstances of the incident. It had a suspicion that Mr Murphy had been driving and that he had been consuming alcohol earlier in the night. The omission to reveal the information, even done deliberately, did not create any false belief in the insurer which in any way improved the insured’s prospects in respect of the claim. The claim was not made fraudulently. Further, the insured did not, even though he deliberately withheld the information, do so with an intention of obtaining payment or some other benefit under the policy. <br /><strong>74.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, the finding of fact made by the magistrate was open to her on the evidence. Further, in my opinion, the learned magistrate’s conclusion was correct. The appeal fails. <br /><strong>75.</strong>&nbsp;Subject to any submissions by counsel, I propose to make the following orders: <br />(i) That the appeal be dismissed. <br />(ii) That the appellant pay the respondent’s costs including reserved costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See p8 of her Honour’s reasons. <br />[2] See p11 of her Honour’s reasons. <br />[3] See p11 of her Honour’s reasons. <br />[4] See p10 of her Honour’s reasons. <br />[5] (1987) 4 ANZ Insurance Cases – 60-812. <br />[6] At 74,987. <br />[7] (1991) 6 ANZ Ins Cases 61-059. <br />[8] See <em>Briginshaw v Briginshaw </em>(1938) 60 CLR 336 and <em>Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd </em>[1957] 1 QB 247 at 258. <br />[9] See Rule 58.07 of the <em>Supreme Court Rules</em>. <br />[10] [1989] VR 8. <br />[11] (2001) 3 VR 279. <br />[12] Supra. <br />[13] At p285. <br />[14] At p286. <br />[15] (1885) 1 TLR 460 at 461. <br />[16] See Ivamy, <em>General Principles of Insurance Law</em>, 2nd ed, p363 footnote 14. <br />[17] (1921) 7 Ll L Rep 139. <br />[18] (1858) 120 ER 796. <br />[19] [1966] VR 513 at 517. <br />[20] (1889) 14 App Cas 337 at 374. <br />[21] Supra at p343. <br />[22] (1866) 4 F and F 905; 176 ER 843. <br />[23] At ER 444. <br />[24] Supra at 205. <br />[25] [2003] 1 AC 469 at 499. <br />[26] See <em>Gouldstone v Royal Insurance Co </em>(1858) 1 F &amp; F 276; 175 ER 725. <br />[27] (1938) 60 CLR 336. <br />[28] At p361. <br />[29] At p363. <br />[30] See <em>TAC v Hoffman </em>[1989] VR 197 at 200. <br />[31] [1956] VLR 38 at 41. <br />[32] See also <em>Taylor v Armour and Company Pty Ltd </em>[1962] VR 346; and <em>Spurling v Development Underwriting (Vic) Pty Ltd </em>[1973] VR 1 at 11. <br />[33] At p11. <br />[34] At 286.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the appellant Insurance Manufacturers of Australia Pty Ltd: Mr H Austin, counsel.

Where the summons was later struck out for non-compliance with the provisions of s30(3) of the Act, the magistrate was in error in refusing an application for reinstatement of the charges on the ground that there was no proceeding on foot and that the general principle did not apply where a charge had been struck out in accordance with the mandatory requirements of s30(3) of the Act.<br />3.&nbsp; Where a summons was not issued within 7 days of signing the charge-sheet, no proceeding was commenced and accordingly the provisions of s30(2)(a) and (3) of the Act did not mandate the striking out of the charges. However, a magistrate was in error in refusing an application for reinstatement of the charges on the ground that there was no proceeding which could be reinstated and that the general principle did not apply.<br /><br />WILLIAMS J:<br />The applications <br />1.</strong>&nbsp;There are applications before the Court in each proceeding which can be conveniently dealt with together. The plaintiff in each proceeding seeks relief in the nature of certiorari and mandamus in relation to orders made on 24 June 2005 in the Magistrates’ Court at Ringwood dismissing applications for the reinstatement of charges against the second defendant. The charges had been struck out under s30(3) of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 ("the Act"). The plaintiff asks the Court to quash the decision to make the orders and to remit the reinstatement application to the Magistrates’ Court for further hearing according to law.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The applications raise issues as to the effect of s30 of the Act. Section 30 appears in Division 2 of Part 4 of the Act. Part 4 deals with criminal proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court and Division 2 with the procedure in those criminal proceedings. The Magistrates’ Court General Regulations 2000 ("the Regulations") also relevantly supplement the provisions of the Act.<br /><strong>The Act <br />3.</strong>&nbsp;The Act provides as follows for the commencement of criminal proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court:<br />"26. How criminal proceeding commenced <br />(1) A criminal proceeding must be commenced by filing a charge— <br />(a) with a registrar; or <br />(b) if the defendant is arrested without a warrant and is released on bail, with a bail justice. <br />(1A) If a proceeding is commenced under sub-section (1)(a) by filing a charge with a registrar other than the appropriate registrar, the informant must file a copy of the charge with the appropriate registrar within 7 days after the commencement of the proceeding. <br />(2) A charge must be on a charge-sheet signed by the informant.<br />... <br />(4) A proceeding for a summary offence must be commenced not later than 12 months after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, except where otherwise provided by or under any other Act. <br />... <br />28. Compelling attendance <br />(1) On the filing of a charge under section 26 an application may be made to the appropriate registrar, or to the registrar at the venue of the Court at which the charge is filed if a copy of the charge has not yet been filed with the appropriate registrar, for the issue of— <br />(a) a summons to answer to the charge; or <br />(b) a warrant to arrest— <br />in order to compel the attendance of the defendant. <br />(2) An application under sub-section (1)(b) must be made by the informant but an application under sub-section (1)(a) may be made by the informant or a person on behalf of the informant. <br />... <br />(4) On an application under sub-section (1), the registrar must, if satisfied that the charge discloses an offence known to law, issue— <br />(a) a summons to answer to the charge; or <br />(b) subject to sub-section (5), a warrant to arrest. <br />(5) A registrar must not issue in the first instance a warrant to arrest unless satisfied by evidence on oath or by affidavit that— <br />(a) it is probable that the defendant will not answer a summons; or <br />(b) the defendant has absconded, is likely to abscond or is avoiding service of a summons that has been issued; or <br />(c) a warrant is required or authorised by any other Act or for other good cause. <br />29. Magistrate may exercise registrar’s powers<br />A magistrate may exercise any of the powers of a registrar for the purpose of issuing criminal process.<br />30. Prescribed persons may issue summons <br />(1) Without limiting the power of a registrar in any way— <br />(a) a member of the police force; or <br />(b) in the case of a charge for a prescribed summary offence, a prescribed person— <br />may, at the time of signing a charge-sheet, issue a summons to answer to the charge. <br />(2) If a member of the police force or a prescribed person issues a summons under sub-section (1)— <br />(a) he or she must file the charge and summons with the appropriate registrar within 7 days after signing the charge-sheet; and <br />(b) the proceeding for the offence is commenced at the time the charge-sheet is signed, despite anything to the contrary in section 26(1). <br />(3) Subject to sub-section (4), if it appears to the Court that sub-section (2)(a) has not been complied with in relation to a proceeding, the Court must strike out the charge and may, in addition, award costs against the informant. <br />(4) If a member of the police force or a prescribed person issues a summons under sub-section (1) and files the charge and summons with the registrar at a venue of the Court other than the proper venue, sub-clauses (2A) and (2B) of clause 1 of Schedule 2 apply to the hearing and determination of the charge, whether or not the charge is for a summary offence. <br />... <br />33. Summons to answer to a charge<br />(1) A summons to answer to a charge must direct the defendant to attend at the proper venue on a certain date and at a certain time to answer the charge.<br />(2) On the application of the informant at any time before the service of a summons to answer to a charge, the mention date specified in the summons may be extended without cause—<br />(a) before the mention date; or<br />(b) within one month after the mention date—<br />by the appropriate registrar on one occasion and thereafter may be extended—<br />(c) before the current mention date; or<br />(d) within one month after the current mention date—<br />by the appropriate registrar if he or she is satisfied by evidence on oath or by affidavit that reasonable efforts have been made to serve the summons." <br /><strong>The Regulations <br />4.</strong>&nbsp;Regulation 801 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court General Regulations </em>2000 ("the Regulations") provides that a member of the police force of more than two years’ standing is a "prescribed person" who may issue a summons to answer a charge at the time of signing a charge-sheet. Regulation 802 designates a summary offence against the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986 and any subordinate instruments as a "prescribed summary offence" for the purposes of s30(1). Regulation 1301 provides that the forms to be used in criminal proceedings are set out in Schedule 5 to the Regulations. Form 5 is a form entitled "Charge" and Form 7, a "Charge and Summons".<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;It is common ground that the police informants, Senior Constable Andrew Jones, in the case of Mr Cyberman, and Senior Constable David Kealy, in that of Mr Hogg, were at relevant times prescribed persons within the meaning of s30(1), under reg 801 of the Regulations.<br /><strong>The charges <br />6.</strong>&nbsp;The charges against Mr Cyberman related to one alleged prescribed offence under each of s49(1)(b) and s49(1)(f) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986 and another under r20 of the <em>Road Rules</em>[1]. Mr Hogg, similarly, was charged with one prescribed offence under each of s49(1)(b) and s49(1)(f) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The respective charge-sheets were signed by Senior Constable Jones and Senior Constable Kealy. Senior Constable Jones and Senior Constable Kealy each purported to compel the defendant’s attendance to answer the charges, by issuing a summons using the process under s30(1) of the Act.<br /><strong>The chronology of events <br />8.</strong>&nbsp;The chronology of events is significant, in light of the statutory requirements with regard to the time of the signing, issuing and filing of relevant documents. There was no dispute about the facts upon which the applications for review are premised.<br /><strong><em>Jones v Cyberman <br /></em>9.</strong>&nbsp;On 27 January 2004, Senior Constable Jones signed a document entitled "Charge and Summons" in the form of Form 7 prescribed by the Regulations. The details of the charges indicate that they relate to alleged offences on 9 November 2003. Senior Constable Jones issued a summons directing Mr Cyberman to attend a hearing on 19 March 2004 at the Ringwood Magistrates’ Court. The summons refers to "S 30" and indicates that it was issued by the police informant. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;On 12 February 2004, the Charge and Summons was filed at the Magistrates’ Court at Ringwood.<br /><strong><em>Kealy v Hogg <br /></em>11.</strong>&nbsp;On 13 September 2003, Senior Constable Kealy signed a Form 7 "Charge and Summons" in relation to alleged offences by Mr Hogg on 5 September 2003. The document shows that it was, however, not until some 26 days later, on 9 October 2003, that Senior Constable Kealy, described as a "Prescribed Person" issued the summons to attend a hearing on 10 November 2003. Although it is not apparent from the document in evidence, it is common ground that the Charge and Summons was filed at the Ringwood Magistrates’ Court on 9 October 2003.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;(A further charge-sheet was signed on 22 December 2004 by Senior Constable Kealy purporting to relate to the charges against Mr Hogg. The charge is described in the charge-sheet as follows: "Duplicate charge as filed on 9 October 2003 at the Ringwood Magistrates’ Court - see attached certified photocopy – case number R 02352855 refers". The learned Magistrate was satisfied that the 22 December 2004 charge did not disclose an offence known to the law. The plaintiff does not take issue with that decision in this application.)<br /><strong>The striking out of the charges <br /><em>Jones v Cyberman</em></strong><em> <br /></em><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;On 16 February 2005, a Magistrate at the Ringwood Magistrates’ Court conducted a hearing in relation to the charges against Mr Cyberman. Mr Cyberman appeared under protest and argued that the charges against him ought to be struck out for non-compliance with s30(2)(a) of the Act. The Magistrate struck out the charges under s30(3).<br /><strong><em>Kealy v Hogg <br /></em>14.</strong>&nbsp;The charges against Mr Hogg were heard at the Magistrates’ Court at Ringwood by a different Magistrate on 21 April 2005. Counsel for Mr Hogg appeared under protest, submitting that the charges should be struck out under s30(3) of the Act or, in the alternative, that the proceeding was a nullity.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate concluded that there had been what he described as a "breach" of s30(1) of the Act, because Senior Constable Kealy had not issued the summons until some 26 days after the time at which he signed the charge-sheet. His Honour relied upon the decisions of the Court in <em>Sinclair v the Magistrates’ Court at Ringwood &amp; Anor</em>[2] and Gahan v Frahm[3] to conclude that strict compliance with s 30(1) was required for the adoption of the alternative procedure under that provision. He supported this interpretation of the legislative intent by noting that a summons would be issued under s28(4)(b) of the Act contemporaneously with the filing of a charge under s26(1)(a) when a criminal proceeding was commenced under that sub-section. Referring to the requirement under s26(4) for a proceeding to be commenced within 12 months of the date of the alleged offence the subject of the relevant charge, he expressed the view that it would be "unconscionable and an abuse of process" for an informant to be permitted to commence a proceeding under s30(2)(b) by signing a charge-sheet within the twelve month period and to delay the issuing of a summons until after the expiration of that period. The Magistrate considered that the elapse of 26 days between the signing of the charge-sheet and the issuing of the summons meant that the contemporaneity required by s30(1) was absent. As a result of the failure to issue a summons under s30(1) there was no proceeding commenced under s30(2)(b). <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate also expressed the view that no proceeding had ever been commenced against Mr Hogg, on the basis that its commencement was conditional upon compliance with s30(2)(a). <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Despite his conclusion that there was no proceeding on foot because of the non-compliance with s30(1), the Magistrate determined that s30(3) obliged the court to strike out the charge for failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of s30(2)(a). He stated:<br />"It is open to the court to strike out the charges variously because of the mandatory requirement of s30(3), for want of strict compliance with a mandatory provision (<em>Sinclair v The Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Ringwood &amp; Anor</em>) or for want of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the charges are struck out."<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate did not specifically address the issue as to whether a proceeding had been commenced against Mr Hogg, under s26(1), upon the filing of the Charge and Summons. <br /><strong>The reinstatement applications <br />19.</strong>&nbsp;On 6 May 2005, applications were made for the reinstatement of the charges against Mr Hogg as well as those against Mr Cyberman, to the Magistrate who had conducted the hearing in relation to the charges against Mr Hogg. On 24 June 2005, his Honour handed down his reasons for decision in relation to the reinstatement applications, immediately after stating his reasons for striking out the charges against Mr Hogg. Under s10 of the <em>Administrative Law Act </em>1978, his Honour’s reasons form part of the record upon which the plaintiff argues errors of law appear. <br /><strong><em>Kealy v Hogg <br /></em>20.</strong>&nbsp;Having decided that no proceeding had been commenced against Mr Hogg, the Magistrate concluded that there was "nothing capable of reinstatement". He did not distinguish between the reinstatement of a proceeding after the striking out of a charge under s30(3) and the reinstatement of the struck out charge. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;He went on to consider the application on the alternative basis that he was wrong in concluding that a proceeding had never been commenced against Mr Hogg and that therefore there was nothing to be reinstated. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate noted the prosecution’s reliance upon Kellam J’s conclusion in <em>DPP v Sabransky</em>[4] that it is open for an application to be made in the Magistrates’ Court for the reinstatement of a proceeding struck out without adjudication on the merits. He quoted the following passage from the judgment of Batt JA in <em>DPP v Moore</em>[5]:<br />"The general principle is that what has been struck out, whether it be an information, charge, summons, proceeding or appeal, may be restored or reinstated, because the legal effect of striking out is merely to take the subject matter out of the court lists ... I have in the end come to the conclusion that the principle discerned by Kaye J in <em>R v McGowan </em>([1984] VR 1000 at 1003) from the decision of the Full Court in <em>Thiessen v Fielding </em>((1890) 16 VLR 666) that a court of summary jurisdiction has power to set aside an order striking out a complaint or information which has been made in error, is applicable to the order striking out the charge under s49(1)(f) here. Accordingly that order was interlocutory and the primary judge had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from it."<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate, however, concluded that the principle applied by Batt JA was inapplicable to a situation in which a charge had been struck out in accordance with the mandatory requirements of s30(3). He also characterised an order made under that sub-section as final rather than interlocutory. As a result, he concluded, he had no power to reinstate the charge.<br /><strong><em>Jones v Cyberman <br /></em>24.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate also refused the application for reinstatement of the charges against Mr Cyberman, stating that he did so for the reasons for which he had rejected the application to reinstate those against Mr Hogg. <br /><strong>Both cases <br />25.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate stated that, in the circumstances, it was unnecessary for him to decide in either case what, if any, would be the proper mechanism to bring an offender back before the court in circumstances where a charge had been struck out under s30(3). <br /><strong>The alleged errors of law <br />26.</strong>&nbsp;The originating motions in each proceeding set out the alleged errors of law, upon the basis of which orders in the nature of <em>certiorari </em>and mandamus are sought. The statements of the alleged errors were amended in the course of submissions by counsel for the plaintiff. Although the originating motions in each case also sought declaratory relief, the plaintiff does not pursue the applications for declaratory relief.<br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;By the amended statement of the alleged errors, the plaintiff seeks a determination as to whether the learned Magistrate erred in refusing to reinstate the proceedings on the grounds that: <br />(a) in the case of Mr Hogg:<br />"(i) non-compliance with s30(1) and s30(2)(a) of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 has the effect of invalidating the proceeding and in this particular case the proceedings were never commenced, so the Magistrate did not have power to reinstate them; <br />(ii) the charges were a nullity, so the Magistrate did not have power to reinstate them; and <br />(iii) there was no power to reinstate the charges"; <br />and<br />(b) in the case of Mr Cyberman:<br />"(i) non-compliance with s30(2)(a) of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 has the effect of invalidating the proceeding and in this particular case the proceedings were never commenced, so the Magistrate did not have power to reinstate them; <br />(ii) the charges were a nullity, so the Magistrate did not have power to reinstate them; and <br />(iii) there was no power to reinstate the charges".<br /><strong>Submissions <br />28.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff submits that there could have been proceedings commenced under s30(2)(b) against each defendant, notwithstanding any failure to comply with the requirements of s30(2)(a). Further, counsel for the plaintiff contends that an order striking out charges under s30(3) does not have the effect that the subject proceeding was a nullity. The plaintiff also argues that the Magistrate, in the circumstances of each case, did have an inherent power to reinstate the charges struck out.<br /><strong><em>Kealy v Hogg <br /></em>29.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff concedes that Senior Constable Kealy did not issue a summons in accordance with the procedure under s30(1) within sufficient time for a proceeding to have been commenced against Mr Hogg under s30(2)(b). He makes this concession on the basis that Senior Constable Kealy failed to issue a summons to Mr Hogg within seven days of signing the charge-sheet, rendering compliance with s30(2)(a) impossible.<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;He submits that s30(1) of the Act provides an alternative procedure to compel the attendance of a defendant to answer a charge by giving a prescribed person power to issue a summons at any time after the charge-sheet has been signed and before the seven day period for the filing of the charge-sheet and summons under s30(2)(a) has expired. He relies upon the legislature’s use of the word "may" in s30(1) in support of his argument. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Hogg, on the other hand, submits that, as the procedure under s30 (1) had not been followed, the Magistrate was correct in refusing to reinstate the charges against him on the basis that no proceeding had ever been commenced. He contends that the informant did not purport to commence a proceeding under s26, by the filing of the charge against Mr Hogg, having attempted to instigate the process under s30. Accordingly, there was no proceeding to reinstate against his client, notwithstanding that the charge and summons had been filed. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Hogg supports what he contends is the Magistrate’s view that a proceeding struck out under s30(3) of the Act cannot be reinstated, because it was a nullity by reason of the failure to comply with s30(2)(a). <br /><strong><em>Jones v Cyberman <br /></em>33.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff submits that, in the case of Mr Cyberman, the proceeding was commenced at the time of signing the charge-sheet, by the operation of s30(2)(b), because Senior Constable Jones did issue the summons against Mr Cyberman in accordance with the procedure set out in s30(1). He goes on to argue that the proceeding was "potentially on foot" for seven days, pending the filing of the charge and summons in accordance with s30(2)(a). It follows, he argues, that the Magistrate erred in concluding that the proceeding in that case had never been commenced or was invalidated or nullified and could not be reinstated.<br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff, however, concedes for the purposes of this case that, after reinstating a charge struck out under s30(3), it would not be open to the Magistrate (acting under s29) to compel the defendant to answer a resurrected charge, by the exercise of a registrar’s power under s28 to issue a summons. The issue was not canvassed before the court. <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Cyberman responds that it was open to the Magistrate to construe s30 as providing that no proceeding against his client had been commenced as a result of the non-compliance with s30(2)(a). <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;In the alternative, he submits that, even if a proceeding had been commenced, any power of reinstatement of the charges would be discretionary. He goes on to contend that the factors relied upon by the Magistrate in reaching his conclusion that there was no proceeding on foot would constitute proper grounds for refusing to reinstate the charges in the exercise of the discretion. <br /><strong>Conclusions <br />37.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, the statutory scheme under s30 provides an alternative procedure for the issuing of a summons by a prescribed person to compel a defendant to answer a charge in relation to a prescribed summary offence. Section 30(2)(b) of the Act has the effect that a criminal proceeding commences in the Magistrates’ Court upon the signing of the charge-sheet, once a summons has been issued under s30(1). <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;The proceeding commences and continues, despite any non-compliance with s30(2)(a). In other words, compliance with s30(2)(a) is not a condition precedent to the commencement of a proceeding, nor does a failure to comply with the sub-section constitute a breach of a condition subsequent automatically terminating, invalidating or nullifying the proceeding. This view finds support in the terms of s30(3) which refers to the court’s obligation to strike out a charge: "if it appears to the court that sub-section (2)(a) has not been complied with in relation to a proceeding "(emphasis added). <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;Before its amendment by s7 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court (Amendment) Act </em>1994, s30(3) provided that non-compliance with s30(2)(a) resulted in the proceeding being a nullity. That is no longer the case. However, as was common ground, the consequence of non-compliance is now the mandatory requirement that the charge must be struck out.<br /><strong><em>Jones v Cyberman <br /></em>40.</strong>&nbsp;It follows that I conclude, in relation to ground (i), that the learned Magistrate erred in law by concluding that no proceeding had ever been commenced against Mr Cyberman and that he had no power to reinstate the charges against him, as a consequence. At the time of the strike-out order made under s30(3), there was a proceeding on foot against Mr Cyberman by the operation of s30(2)(b). In any event, it was the charges which were the subject of the reinstatement application, not the proceeding. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;As far as ground (ii) is concerned, the Magistrates reasons for decision do not indicate to me that he also decided that he had no power to reinstate the charges against Mr Cyberman because they were nullities. But, had he done so, he would also have erred because there is no warrant for such a conclusion in s30. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;As for ground (iii), in my opinion, the learned Magistrate erred in concluding that he had no power to reinstate the charges against Mr Cyberman, in light of the mandatory requirement to strike them out under s30(3). The application for reinstatement amounted to an application for the setting aside of the previous strike-out order. As Batt JA made clear in <em>DPP v Moore</em>[6], the Magistrates’ Court has an inherent power to set aside an order striking out a charge, and thereby reinstate the charge, if the strike-out order has been made in error. The inherent power exists in relation to an order erroneously made, before the merits are entered into, regardless of the legal justification for the making of the order, absent such error. In <em>Thiessen v Fielding</em>[7], for example, it was held that the justices had jurisdiction to reinstate a case which had been struck out by justices who mistook the effect of evidence relating to the service of a debtor’s summons upon the defendant[8]. In <em>R v McGowan</em>[9], Kaye, J cited <em>Mason v Ryan</em>[10] as authority for the proposition that the exercise of the power to set aside, recognized in <em>Thiessen v Fielding</em>, is not limited to a situation in which an order made in error resulted from a factorial misrepresentation to the court.[11] Kaye, J upheld a magistrate’s order setting aside a previous order striking out an information on the erroneous basis that the court lacked jurisdiction. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;I am not persuaded by the argument by counsel for Mr Cyberman that the principles established by the authorities to which I have referred are inapplicable to orders striking out charges in accordance with a mandatory statutory provision, as opposed to those striking them out for failure to comply with procedural or regulatory requirements. The Magistrate’s error lies in his conclusion that, because of the mandatory nature of s30(3), he lacked the inherent power to exercise a discretion to set aside his former order.<br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;Considerations relating to the mandatory nature of the requirements of s30(3) would, however, have been relevant to the exercise of the Magistrate’s discretion. In my opinion, s30(3) would require the striking out of any reinstated charges against Mr Cyberman in relation to which Senior Constable Jones had issued a summons under s30(1). (I note, in this regard, the significant concession by counsel for the plaintiff to the effect that the operation of the sub-section could not be avoided by an application to the Magistrate seeking his exercise, under s29, of the registrar’s power under s28(1)(a) to issue a summons to compel the defendant’s attendance. He concedes that any such application in relation to the proceeding commenced against Mr Cyberman under s30(2)(b) would not succeed.<br /><strong>45.</strong>&nbsp;In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that, although the Magistrate’s decision in relation to the reinstatement application should be quashed for error of law on the face of the record, it would be futile to remit the application for reinstatement to the Magistrates’ Court for consideration according to law. The application for relief in the nature of <em>certiorari</em> will be granted and the application for an order in the nature of mandamus refused. <br /><strong>Kealy v Hogg <br />46.</strong>&nbsp;The situation in relation to Mr Hogg is different. In that case, Senior Constable Kealy had not properly adopted the alternative procedure under s30(1). He did not issue a summons until some 26 days after signing the charge-sheet.<br /><strong>47.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, it must logically follow from the provisions of s30(2)(a) that the summons issued in accordance with s30(1) must be issued within seven days of the signing of the charge-sheet. Indeed, counsel for the plaintiff concedes as much. However, he submits that the summons need not be issued on the day upon which the charge-sheet is signed. <br /><strong>48.</strong>&nbsp;It is not necessary for me to decide whether the procedure under s30(1) would have been properly invoked if the summons had been issued on a day other than that upon which the charge-sheet was signed, but before the expiration of the seven days referred to in s30(2)(a). Nevertheless, as the plaintiff bases the argument in favour of such an interpretation of s30(1) on the use of the word "may" in the sub-section, I note my view that that word rather indicates that s30(1) provides an alternative procedure for the issuing of a summons. <br /><strong>49.</strong>&nbsp;As the alternative procedure for the issuing of a summons under s30(1) was not followed by Senior Constable Kealy, no proceeding was commenced against Mr Hogg under s30(2)(b) and s30(3) did not mandate the striking out of the charges against him. The learned Magistrate therefore erred in so far as he concluded that he had no power to reinstate the charges against Mr Hogg on the basis of what were the inapplicable provisions of s30(2)(a) and s30(3). <br /><strong>50.</strong>&nbsp;As far as the Magistrate’s conclusion that there was no proceeding against Mr Hogg which could be reinstated is concerned, I note my view that it is at least arguable that a proceeding was commenced against Mr Hogg by the filing of the charges under s26(1)(a). However, the issue for consideration by the Magistrate related to the reinstatement of the charges, as opposed to any proceeding against him.<br /><strong>51.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the plaintiff concedes that, in this case, the failed attempt to adopt the s30(1) procedure could not be supplemented by the Magistrate’s exercise, under s29, of the registrar’s power to issue a summons under s28(1)(a). As a result, notwithstanding the inapplicability of s 30(3), it would also be futile in the case of Mr Hogg to remit the application for reinstatement in the exercise of the court’s inherent power to the Magistrate for consideration according to law.<br /><strong>52.</strong>&nbsp;I will exercise my discretion to grant the relief sought in the nature of certiorari and quash the learned Magistrate’s decision to refuse the reinstatement application in relation to the charges against Mr Hogg. However, in all the circumstances, I will refuse the application for relief in the nature of mandamus.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] Rule 201 of the <em>Road Safety (Road Rules) Regulations </em>1999 provides that the <em>Road Rules </em>are to be read and construed as part of the <em>Road Safety (Road Rules) Regulations </em>1999 made under s95 of the Road Safety Act 1986. <br />[2] [1998] VSC 170. <br />[3] [1999] VSC 410. <br />[4] [2002] VSC 143 at [37]. <br />[5] (2003) 6 VR 430 at [20]. <br />[6] [2003] 6 VR 430 at 437; see relevant passage set out in para [22] above. <br />[7] (1890) 16 VLR 666. <br />[8] (1890) 16 VLR 666 at 668 per Higinbotham CJ, Webb and Hodges, JJ. <br />[9] [1984] VR 1000. <br />[10] (1884) 10 VLR 335. <br />[11] [1984] VR 1000 at 1003.<br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the DPP: Mr G Silbert, counsel.

The thrust of the letters was that C. was not a fit and proper person to hold the position of Local Laws Manager. C. issued proceedings against T. claiming damages together with interest and costs. At the hearing the Magistrate found that the letters were the subject of qualified privilege however, the defence was defeated because malice on T.''s part was established. The Magistrate awarded C. one amount for compensatory and aggravated damages and fixed interest from the date of the first letter. Further, on the question of costs, the Magistrate allowed for Counsel''s fees a sum in excess of the Scale of Costs. Upon appeal—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Appeal allowed. Orders set aside. Remitted for further hearing by another Magistrate.</p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;The publication of each letter constituted a separate cause of action. The Magistrate should have awarded damages in respect of each publication and have stated in his reasons the amount awarded for each head of compensatory damages in respect of each defamatory publication.&nbsp; The Magistrate should not have dealt with the defences in a composite way but should have considered the defences in respect to each cause of action, i.e. each letter.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;Because it was conceded that each letter was published on a privileged occasion, it was necessary to determine in respect of each letter whether at the time of publication T. was actuated by malice. This involved a consideration of the nature and purpose of the privilege, the contents of the letter and all the surrounding circumstances before and after publication which bore on T.''s motive at the time of publication. The qualified privilege defence and the reply of malice required a two step consideration and determination in respect of each cause of action. First, in respect of each communication, was it made on an occasion of qualified privilege? This is a question of law and the burden is on the defendant. The second step is, assuming the communication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege, was the defence defeated by proof of actual malice? This is a question of fact. The burden is on the plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;When the purpose of the occasion which is protected by qualified privilege is properly defined, it cannot be said that to question the conduct of a public official, and to raise doubts about his suitability for office raising the question whether he should continue to be employed in that office, is not a purpose or motive foreign to the duty or interest that protects the making of the statement. The Magistrate misdirected himself on the question of malice and his finding must be set aside. It is clear that the Magistrate placed great weight on what he described as evidence of “an improper motive”. In the circumstances his other findings of evidence of malice cannot support his finding, especially as he did not consider malice in respect of each of the separate causes of action.</p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;The jurisdiction to award damages in the nature of interest on an order made for damages in the Magistrates’ Court is given by s33 of the Supreme Court Act 1986. The section provides that the rules of law enacted in Part 5 of that Act apply to inferior courts and accordingly ss58-60 of the Supreme Court Act apply to the Magistrates’ Court. Section 60(1) requires the Court to award damages in the nature of interest from the commencement of the proceeding until judgment. Interest is awarded from the commencement of the proceeding, and the Court must fix the rate of interest, which must not exceed the rate fixed from time to time under the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983. Accordingly, the Magistrate was in error in ordering T. to pay interest on the damages awarded from the date of the first letter. Interest should have been calculated from the date the proceeding was commenced.</p>\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;There is power under Rule 26.02(2) of the Magistrates'' Court Civil Procedure Rules for the court if it thinks “that any item in the scale is inadequate or excessive”, to allow a greater or lesser sum than the scale provides. An item in the scale may be inadequate taking into account the complexity of the case. The complexity may arise because of the law or the facts or both. The magistrate must make some assessment of the time that would be involved by counsel in preparing the brief for hearing. But the brief fee includes the preparation by counsel. Counsel as a general rule should not be paid more for learning the law which he or she should know. As a general rule, the Magistrates’ Court should be slow to increase the scale fees because the court thinks the item is inadequate. The scale costs and fees should be the norm. The Magistrates’ Court is the court in this state dealing with claims of lesser monetary value than in the higher courts, and the costs should not be at a level which deters litigants. Further, defendants defend proceedings in the expectation that the costs will be determined in accordance with the scale of costs. It is difficult to accept that it was reasonable in this proceeding for the Magistrate to order that T. should have been ordered to pay the sum of $4,011 brief fee and a daily fee thereafter of $3,572.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />GILLARD J:<br />1.&nbsp;This is an appeal by an unsuccessful defendant in a proceeding brought against him in the Magistrates’ Court alleging that he had defamed the plaintiff. The Magistrate held that the plaintiff had proven that the words complained of, written in three letters, were defamatory of him, found against the defendant’s defences and awarded the plaintiff the sum of $40,000 together with interest, and ordered the defendant to pay the costs. The defendant appeals the orders made. </p>\r\n<p>Parties<br />2.&nbsp;The defendant/appellant, Ian Douglas Tankard (“Mr Tankard”) is a retired farmer who at all relevant times resided in Creamery Road, Toolern Vale which is in the Shire of Melton. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;The plaintiff/respondent, John Forest Chafer (“Mr Chafer”) was at all relevant times the Local Laws Manager of the Shire of Melton. </p>\r\n<p>Proceeding in Magistrates’ Court<br />4.&nbsp;On 30 April 2003, Mr Chafer issued a complaint against Mr Tankard in the Magistrates’ Court sitting at Sunshine seeking damages in the sum of $40,000 which included claims for aggravated and exemplary damages, for defamation arising out of three letters sent by Mr Tankard. The three letters were – <br />(i) a letter dated 8 October 1998 addressed to the then Commissioners of the Shire of Melton;<br />(ii) a letter dated 2 December 2001 addressed to Emma Healey, General Manager of the Shire of Melton; and<br />(iii) a letter addressed to Neville Smith, Chief Executive Officer of the Shire of Melton dated 23 June 2002.</p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;In his statement of claim Mr Chafer alleged that some of the words in each letter were defamatory of him, and pleaded a number of defamatory imputations. The imputations were based on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of. The publication of each letter was a separate cause of action. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;In his defence, Mr Tankard denied that the words were defamatory, and alleged defences of justification, qualified privilege and fair comment. Mr Chafer in his reply alleged that the defamatory words were published by Mr Tankard with actual malice, and hence the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment were defeated. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The proceeding commenced before a magistrate on 12 November 2003. Mr Tankard represented himself and Mr Chafer was represented by Mr J Kewley of counsel. The Magistrate heard the proceeding over eight days and on 15 December 2003 reserved his decision. On 19 December 2003, the Magistrate orally delivered his reasons. The reasons were not recorded, however, the Magistrate has provided a type-written version. He found that the words Mr Chafer complained of in respect to each letter were defamatory, and that Mr Tankard had failed to prove the defences of justification and fair comment. He held that the defamatory words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege but Mr Tankard was actuated by malice. Accordingly the defence of qualified privilege was defeated. The Magistrate awarded both compensatory and aggravated damages which he fixed at $40,000 which was the then limit of the court’s jurisdiction. He rejected the claim for exemplary damages. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The Magistrate awarded $40,000 as one sum for compensatory and aggravated damages in respect of the defamatory words contained in three separate letters. In my opinion, the Magistrate was wrong. The publication of each letter constituted a separate cause of action. The case was so pleaded. The Magistrate should have awarded damages in respect to each publication. He should, in my opinion, have stated in his reasons the amount awarded for each head of compensatory damages in respect of each defamatory publication. Mr Tankard has not appealed the error and accordingly it is unnecessary to say anything more about it. However, the Magistrate also dealt with the defences in a composite way. He should have considered the defences in respect to each cause of action, i.e. each letter. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The Magistrate also awarded damages in the nature of interest in the amount of $22,819.70 and ordered Mr Tankard to pay $52,855.73 costs. These two orders are the subject of this appeal. </p>\r\n<p>Appeal to this Court<br />10.&nbsp;Mr Tankard appeals to this Court pursuant to s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. The jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal is limited to an appeal on a question of law from a final order of a Magistrates’ Court. Section 109(2)(a) obliges an unsuccessful party to institute an appeal not later than 30 days “after the day on which the order complained of was made”. This Court does have power to extend time.[1] An appeal must be brought in accordance with the Rules of the Court. Part 3 of Order 58 deals with an appeal to this Court from a Magistrates’ Court. The Rules have recently been amended.[2] An appeal is now instituted by filing a notice of appeal.[3] The notice must state the questions of law and the grounds of appeal. The appellant is required within seven days after filing the notice of appeal to file an affidavit setting out the matters required by Rule 58.09. After this is done the appellant must apply to a Master for directions. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;Mr Tankard failed to institute his appeal within time. On 29 September 2004 he issued an originating motion seeking an extension of time to appeal against the decision made by the Magistrates’ Court. As the new Rules came into operation on 1 October 2004 the present appeal has proceeded under the old Rules, resulting in an order of the Master stating the points of law. In an affidavit filed the same day, Mr Tankard stated that he had had trouble obtaining the reasons for judgment and that he had received the reasons on 24 September 2004. At that stage Mr Tankard was appearing for himself. On 6 October 2004 his present solicitors filed a document stating they were acting for him. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;On 7 October 2004, Mr Tankard filed an originating motion seeking prerogative relief and judicial review of the Magistrate’s orders.[4] On 8 December 2004, Master Wheeler by order extended the time to appeal to 10 December 2004. The originating motion seeking judicial review was adjourned to be heard at the appeal. The Master made the usual order under Rule 58.09 of the old rules and stated the questions of law. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;The parties came before the Court on 21 December 2004 and the Court ordered by consent that the judicial review proceeding be discontinued with no order as to costs. Apparently the parties had agreed that the issues raised in the judicial review proceeding save for one issue be determined as questions of law in this appeal. One of the points of law was set aside by agreement. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;The four remaining questions of law for consideration and determination are: <br />(a) If the occasion of qualified privilege is communication by a rate payer to a municipality concerning land use matters, is seeking to have the respondent sacked from his land use job at the municipality a purpose foreign to that occasion so that the protection of the privilege is lost through malice?<br />(b) Whether the Magistrate erred in awarding damages in the nature of interest calculated on the basis of a period commencing before the commencement of the Magistrates’ Court proceeding?<br />(c) Whether the appellant was denied procedural fairness in that he was not given the opportunity to be heard in respect of the interest order?<br />(d) Whether the appellant was denied procedural fairness in that he was not given an opportunity to be heard in respect of the Magistrate’s order that he pay the respondent’s costs in the amount of $52,855.73?</p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;On 13 April 2005, Master Kings made orders by consent in relation to this appeal. Paragraph 1 of those orders required the parties to file an agreed summary of facts “which summarises the history of and issues in the proceeding.” </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;The Court received what was described as an agreed summary on 11 May 2005. The parties have assured me that the summary of facts accords with the evidence placed before the Magistrate. In order to understand and make sense of the agreed summary of facts, it is necessary to briefly state the circumstances leading to the forwarding of the three letters. In August 1996, Mr Tankard’s residence caught fire and was badly burnt. Thereafter the Shire of Melton (“the Shire”) took steps to have the house demolished. Mr Tankard objected to the actions of the Shire. In August 1998 a complaint was received by the Shire as to the state of Mr Tankard’s property and on 13 August 1998 Mr Chafer, as the authorised officer, signed a notice requiring Mr Tankard to clean up his property. On 8 October 1998, Mr Tankard wrote a very long letter to the three Commissioners of the Shire in which he dealt with the matters referred to in the notice and raised matters which reflected upon Mr Chafer and in particular whether he was properly carrying out his duties as an authorised officer of the Shire. This letter constituted the first cause of action in defamation. Thereafter, there were court proceedings involving the Shire and Mr Tankard which went from the Magistrates’ Court to this Court and the Court of Appeal. Mr Tankard had some success in that litigation. In November 2001, the Shire served a Fire Prevention Notice on Mr and Mrs Slater, neighbours of Mr Tankard, and with the authority of Mr and Mrs Slater he wrote a letter to the manager of the Shire in which he dealt with the notice served on Mr and Mrs Slater. In the letter he made some observations about Mr Chafer and raised questions as to whether he was a fit and proper person to be employed by the Shire. In early 2002 the Shire engaged in consultation with rate payers in respect to proposed changes to the local law. On 23 June 2002 Mr Tankard wrote another letter addressed to the CEO of the Shire in response to the proposed amendments. In that letter he made a concerted attack upon Mr Chafer and his suitability to be an officer and his mental state. Each of the three letters was the subject matter of a cause of action in defamation. </p>\r\n<p>Agreed Summary of Facts<br />1979&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tankard acquires his property at Creamery Road, Toolern Vale and moves in.<br />1-2 August 1996&nbsp;Tankard’s house catches fire and is three quarters burnt down.<br />5 August 1996&nbsp;Shire issues Emergency Building Order pursuant to Section 102 of the Building Act 1993 requiring demolition of the remains of Tankard’s house.<br />21 October 1996&nbsp;Melton Shire obtains three quotes for demolition of Tankard’s house, and Court Demolition Order of the house by Tankard within 7 days, payment into Court of the anticipated costs of the demolition in the sum of $5,700.00 plus costs of the proceeding.<br />29 October 1996&nbsp;Magistrates’ Court conviction against Tankard for failing to comply with Demolition Order.<br />30 October 1996&nbsp;Melton Shire letter to Tankard advising of intention to demolish remainder of his house.<br />6 November 1996&nbsp;Melton Shire engages Demolition Contractor and remainder of Tankard’s house is demolished.<br />5 December 1996&nbsp;Melton Shire invoices Tankard for the cost of the demolition.

The orders the subject of this appeal were made by the Magistrate on 19 December 2003. Mr Chafer’s solicitors have sought to enforce the orders made by a warrant of seizure and sale which was registered in this Court, resulting in the sheriff taking steps to sell Mr Tankard’s property. Mr Tankard has taken steps to stay the warrant and at present the sale has not taken place. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;It can be seen from the above agreed facts that this Court does not have the evidence of any witness. Nor does the Court have the reasons for judgment. </p>\r\n<p>Qualified Privilege and Malice<br />19.&nbsp;The learned Magistrate referred to the High Court decision of Roberts v Bass[5] and the Court of Appeal decision of The Herald and Weekly Times Limited &amp; Bolt v Popovic.[6] </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;In Roberts v Bass, in the joint judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ, their Honours referred to a general definition of qualified privilege.[7] The Magistrate referred to what their Honours said. Under the heading of “Malice” their Honours exhaustively considered the principles of law that apply to the issue of malice.[8] The Magistrate made reference to observations made by their Honours. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;The Magistrate then dealt with the defence of qualified privilege and the issue of malice. It is clear from submissions put to the Magistrate by counsel on behalf of Mr Chafer that there was no contest that each letter was published on an occasion of qualified privilege. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;The submission provided: <br />“The plaintiff concedes that in so far as the relevant letters of the defendant purported to complain about or comment on Shire matters they are prima facie the subject of qualified privilege.”</p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;The description of the occasion is different to what the Magistrate found. Both the submission and the description by the Magistrate overlooked a well established category of qualified privilege, namely, communications concerning the conduct of public officials.[9] </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;The Magistrate said:[10] <br />“In relation to the defence of qualified privilege I accept that the nature of the duty or interest that gives rise to the privilege is the right of rate payers to publish to the Shire matters relating to land use. I note Mr Tankard’s frank acknowledgement in evidence that he sought the sacking of Mr Chafer by his correspondence. In my opinion such evidence constitutes an improper motive. The advocating of the termination of Mr Chafer was a purpose foreign to the occasion that gave the publication the protection of qualified privilege. The personal attack on Mr Chafer in the third letter which was purportedly dealing with local law reform proposals, was also evidence of improper motive. In my opinion the use by Mr Tankard of the words complained of is reckless, in that there was no evidence as to the accuracy and that Mr Tankard was indifferent to their possible harmful consequences to Mr Chafer’s reputation. When taken in combination with the evidence of Mr Tankard that the purpose of the correspondence was the sacking of Mr Chafer, in my opinion, malice is established and the defence of qualified privilege defeated.”</p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;It is observed that the Magistrate has dealt with the defence of qualified privilege and the issue of malice in respect of the three letters. In my opinion his approach was wrong. He was bound to consider the defence in respect to each letter as each letter constituted a separate cause of action, and more importantly, because it was conceded that each letter was published on a privileged occasion, it was necessary to determine in respect to each letter whether at the time of publication Mr Tankard was actuated by malice. This involved a consideration of the nature and purpose of the privilege, the contents of the letter and all the surrounding circumstances before and after publication which bore on Mr Tankard’s motive at the time of publication. This involves Mr Tankard’s state of mind at the relevant time, being the date of publication of the particular letter. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;His Honour’s reasoning can be summarised – <br />(i) There was a common interest or a duty existing between a rate payer and the Shire concerning land use and hence the communications were published on occasions protected by qualified privilege.<br />(ii) Mr Tankard’s statement that he sought the sacking of Mr Chafer by his correspondence showed that the communication was for an improper motive.<br />(iii) The advocating of termination of his employment was a purpose foreign to the occasion.<br />(iv) The personal attack in the third letter purportedly dealing with local law reforms was also evidence of improper motive.<br />(v) Mr Tankard’s use of the words complained of was reckless, there was no evidence as to the accuracy of what he stated, he was indifferent to the possible harmful consequences to Mr Chafer’s reputation and when taken in combination the purpose of the correspondence was to have Mr Chafer sacked, malice had been established and the defence of qualified privilege defeated. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;The qualified privilege defence and the reply of malice required a two step consideration and determination in respect to each cause of action. First, in respect of each communication, was it made on an occasion of qualified privilege? This is a question of law and the burden is on the defendant. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;The second step is, assuming the communication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege, was the defence defeated by proof of actual malice? This is a question of fact. The burden is on the plaintiff. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;As already noted, the Magistrate did not deal with each cause of action separately. However, this error is not the subject of a question of law. The first question of law accepts that the occasion of each publication was the subject of qualified privilege and raises the issue whether Mr Tankard’s statement in evidence that he wished to have Mr Chafer sacked was evidence of malice which defeated the defence in respect to each publication. Although the parties informed the Court that it was their belief that Mr Tankard had expressed in his letters the wish to have Mr Chafer dismissed, a careful consideration of each of the letters did not bear this out. It is clear that Mr Tankard in each letter was critical of Mr Chafer, and did raise questions as to his suitability to perform his job as Local Laws Manager. In the first letter, which was in response to an earlier Shire letter, and in the context of saying Mr Chafer “and those who incite him” did not have a legal basis to act, Mr Tankard went on to write: <br />“You mention ‘accusations and ill-founded statements’, thus already exhibiting a defensive bias to protect those who deserve dismissal. The total spill of councils leading to your appointment was for the purpose of reorganising the municipal structure.”</p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;I interpolate to note that the letter was sent to one of the Commissioners of the Shire. There was no statement in any of the letters that he demanded the dismissal of Mr Chafer, but he did raise issues of whether Mr Chafer should be the Local Laws Manager. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;However, the Magistrate relied upon what Mr Tankard said in evidence to that effect. </p>\r\n<p>Points of Law<br />32.&nbsp;At the outset, it is necessary to briefly summarise the letters. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;The first letter, dated 8 October 1998, was addressed to the three Commissioners of the Shire of Melton. At that time the three Commissioners were in charge of the Shire. It is alleged in the particulars of claim that there were three portions of the letter which were defamatory of the plaintiff. </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;The first letter was written shortly after Mr Tankard had received the Notice to Comply. The Notice to Comply was signed by Mr Chafer. He was the authorised officer and expressed his opinion that Mr Tankard had committed a breach of Local Laws by occupying unsightly and dangerous premises. The notice required Mr Tankard within 30 days to perform a number of tasks including removing stock piles of glass bottles, unregistered motor vehicles and other rubbish. The letter was a reply to a letter written by one of the Commissioners dated 29 September 1998. The latter letter is not before the Court, but according to the agreed facts that letter agreed to extend time for Mr Tankard to comply with the notice to remove the rubbish et cetera. Mr Tankard’s letter was handwritten and comprised 68 pages. It covered a number of topics, but in the main dealt with the issue of whether Mr Tankard was required to comply with the notice, raised the questions of its legality, and questioned the opinion of Mr Chafer as to whether the state of Mr Tankard’s premises was a breach of the Shire’s Local Law. The front sheet to the letter contained a photostat copy of an extract from a local paper where it was said: <br />“Melton Shire rate payers can now expect the highest standards of customer service in all areas of council operations. Council recently adopted a series of customer service charters guaranteeing a professional, efficient and responsive service.”</p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;Mr Tankard noted next to the photostat the following:<br />“CONGRATULATIONS on establishing the largest industry in Melton yet<br />THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS SERVICE”.</p>\r\n<p>36.&nbsp;On the first page Mr Tankard made clear the purpose of his letter. He wrote: <br />“An individualist like myself is not going to be an Aunt Sally to municipal bigotry that does not have a legal basis. Because Mr Chafer, and those who incite him, don’t have legal basis for their demands, I am not required to act. As a mature adult, I decide my priorities and values that don’t harm others. You mention, ‘accusations and ill-found statements’, thus already exhibiting a defensive bias to protect those who deserve dismissal. The total spill of councils leading to your appointment was for the purpose of reorganising the municipal structure.”</p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;He then, on the following pages, set out what he described as “abstract of its contents” which was an index of the topics he discussed in the letter. In my opinion, the index and the contents of the letter show Mr Tankard is a person who was concerned about the demands made upon him by the Notice to Comply. He raised questions as to its legality, and also raised questions as to what he described as the “illegalities and injustices inflicted on me”. He dealt specifically with drainage and weed problems allegedly created by council action and inaction, and raised the failure of the Shire and its officers to perform their public duties. In addition to criticising Mr Chafer, Mr Tankard also criticised other officers of the Shire. He did, in my opinion, raise the question of their suitability for office and whether they deserved dismissal. He made the point that since he was a rate payer he had the right “like a shareholder (to) possess the right to applaud or deride or go beyond.” He then observed: <br />“You as Commissioners are not being blasted from A to Z, but chiefly as to not keeping your staff accountable for their often untrained and unprincipled actions.”</p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;He criticised Mr Chafer not only in respect of the Notice to Comply but also because he had failed to take certain steps in relation to the cutting of the grass outside his premises, which he asserted was a matter for the Shire. </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;The letter was long, rambling, in parts was offensive, ridiculing and critical, but nevertheless was a letter by a rate payer to the Commissioners of the Shire raising matters which clearly were relevant to the Commissioners’ role and raising questions of the suitability of certain Shire employees, including Mr Chafer. In my view, on a fair reading the document does raise the question whether or not the Commissioners should determine whether the officers should be dismissed. </p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;Mr Tankard concluded his letter by asking a series of questions under the heading: “SALIENT ISSUES NEEDING ADDRESSING”. The first question under the heading “LOCAL LAW 1 – NOTICE TO COMPLY” was as follows: <br />“Q.1 How can you justify the employment of Mr Chafer in the general role of harassing, prosecuting and threatening seizures and destructions of property – when the man is a bully in approach and an ignoramus at law?”</p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;Although that was expressed as a question, much of what preceded the question did identify factual matters alleging that Mr Chafer adopted a certain approach and that he was ignorant of the law. It is noted that Mr Tankard also raised questions in relation to other employees. He also raised the question as to whether the Commissioners “maintain spot checks of staff in relation to their knowledge of the laws that control their performances?” </p>\r\n<p>42.&nbsp;On a proper reading, Mr Tankard raised questions as to Mr Chafer’s understanding of his duties of office, alleged that he had been derelict in the performance of his duties, alleged that he was a man of questionable character and did seriously raise the question whether he was a fit and proper person to hold the position of Local Laws Manager. The thrust of the letter leads to the conclusion that Mr Tankard was raising the serious question for the Commissioners of whether Mr Chafer should have been permitted to remain in his office. </p>\r\n<p>43.&nbsp;The second cause of action was alleged to have arisen out of a letter written by Mr Tankard, dated 2 December 2001, some three years after the first letter and sent to the General Manager of the Shire of Melton. Six parts of the letter were identified in the particulars of claim as being defamatory. </p>\r\n<p>44.&nbsp;This letter has to be considered in its setting. There had been a long and drawn out battle involving the Notice to Comply. Mr Tankard had had some success. The Shire issued a complaint against Mr Tankard to recover the cost of cleaning up his property, and it was dismissed. The Shire appealed to the Supreme Court and the appeal was dismissed by Mandie J on the basis the notice was not valid. The Shire further appealed to the Court of Appeal and the appeal was dismissed for the same reason; the notice was not valid. This letter was written by Mr Tankard on behalf of a Mr and Mrs J. Slater who authorised the letter. It was addressed to the Manager of the Shire of Melton. It was a letter written in response to the service of a Fire Prevention Notice on Mr and Mrs Slater dated 20 November 2001. Mr and Mrs Slater are aged in their eighties, have limited education and both are frail. Both signed each page of the letter. A further fact must be noted. </p>\r\n<p>45.&nbsp;Back in October 1998 a Notice to Comply was served on Mr and Mrs Slater, who resided near Mr Tankard, requiring them to remove various items from their property. The Shire took steps to clean up their property. The Slaters were subsequently sued and a judgment in the sum of about $86,000 was entered against them. This was subsequently set aside by consent. The purpose of the letter appeared on page 1 and was expressed to be: <br />“The reason for writing to you, is that you are responsible for the control and supervision of staff/contractors below you to ensure they obey the law.”</p>\r\n<p>46.&nbsp;The letter set out in some detail the legal encounters involving the Slaters and the Shire, which also involved Mr Chafer. The letter then went on to deal with the Fire Prevention Notice which had been served upon the Slaters. Mr Tankard, on behalf of the Slaters, argued that the notice was invalid and criticised Mr Chafer for his carelessness. Mr Tankard referred to a variety of statutes and laws and raised the question of Mr Chafer’s suitability as Local Laws Manager. He again raised matters which allegedly related to Mr Chafer failing to do certain things concerning a number of horses that appeared to be needing attention. It is clear from the words under the heading “IN RETROSPECT” that the letter on behalf of the Slaters was fuelled to some extent by the history of the earlier dispute between the Slaters and the Shire concerning the Notice to Comply. Under the heading of “Abuse of the process” Mr Tankard wrote: <br />“By targeting Mr Slater, and failing to control Mr Chafer, apparently all your fire prevention notices are invalid, which is a pity, because surely some are deserved. However Mr Chafer doesn’t create any inspiration by his roadside activities and blockheadedness to the rights of others. An encouraging smile achieves far more than a savage bark.”</p>\r\n<p>47.&nbsp;Mr Tankard then attached to the letter an index and a number of documents. He also attached photostat copies of portions of Regulations and an Act. </p>\r\n<p>48.&nbsp;The letter comprised some 25 pages, including the attachments, and the handwritten portion comprised 14 pages. Like the first letter, it rambled to some extent, and at times the wording was offensive, challenging and extremely critical. But the letter did raise queries on behalf of the Slaters about the validity of the Fire Prevention Notice, queries about Mr Chafer’s suitability for office, questions as to the legality of certain steps taken by Mr Chafer and others, and exhorted the addressee as a person being responsible for the control and supervision of staff to ensure they obeyed the law. </p>\r\n<p>49.&nbsp;The third cause of action is based upon a letter dated 6 June 2002, sent by Mr Tankard to the Chief Executive Officer of the Shire. Six parts of the letter are relied upon as being defamatory of Mr Chafer. This letter was sent after the Shire, in early 2002, engaged in public consultation in respect to proposed changes to the Local Law. That was made clear by the first sentence of the letter which read under the heading “SUBJECT” as follows: <br />“A sustained objection to the proposed amendments to Local Law 1 (4 Clauses) on the bases of – “.</p>\r\n<p>50.&nbsp;The first basis was expressed to be: <br />“(a) its prior operation against the lawful well-being on myself and Mr Jim Slater.”</p>\r\n<p>51.&nbsp;The bases included the observation that “the amendments being just so superficial, so as to retain all the flaws” and also a challenge that there had been a failure to pay heed to Mr Tankard’s arguments on law and administration in his 1998 long letter to the Commissioners. Other objections were: <br />“(m) the retention of the expression ‘Opinion of an Authorised Officer’ that brings a solo predominant grotesque image”.<br />(n) The obliviousness of yourself, management and councillors that in my opinion this person has a serious psychopathic disorder, to an extent for it to be observable by lay persons – this matter was addressed in the 80 page letter ...". </p>\r\n<p>52.&nbsp;The references were clearly to Mr Chafer. One other subject of the objection was “the non-curbing – or rather re-endorsement and encouragement of the repetition of the 1998 spree of a single man unleashed upon chosen victims without regard to law, delegation, ethics or morals”. On page 3 Mr Tankard stated that the letter was not an attack upon the present Councillors or Managers but was a serious article to educate them as to the concerns, and it challenged the CEO to study the court cases which, it was asserted, were “caused by the opinion of a single man”. Mr Tankard then dealt with the legal aspects of the four amendments, made criticisms of them and returned to criticising Mr Chafer’s actions against him and Mr Slater. He tabulated the court cases and noted that the origin of the cases was based upon the opinion of Mr John Chafer. In the following pages Mr Tankard attacked the activities and non-activities of Mr Chafer, the costs involved and then, over seven closely written pages, did an analysis of Mr Chafer and asserted, “Mr Chafer suffers from a psychopathic infliction known as narcissism, which is basically is excessive craving for ego satisfaction, or an obsession for centrafacation of attention.” Mr Tankard then referred to the conduct of Mr Chafer and also to a chapter of a textbook on character formation and self-development. </p>\r\n<p>53.&nbsp;Mr Tankard on the last page concluded in summary form the purpose of the letter. He noted that he had attacked the “flimsy bandaid amendments” and noted that they did not overcome the flaws “the worst of which is leaving anything to the opinion of Mr Chafer”. He further criticised the administration and asserted that the letter was not written with hostility “but with the concern and seriousness of somebody who has experienced and survived as yet, a sequence of municipal assaults.” </p>\r\n<p>54.&nbsp;The letter, like the other two, was written in a hard hitting, critical style, at times was offensive and challenging, and spent considerable time criticising Mr Chafer. The criticisms of Mr Chafer are substantial and serious. On a fair reading Mr Tankard alleges that Mr Chafer acts with improper motives in the performance of his office, that he is ignorant of his duties, derelict, incompetent, is not a fit and proper person to hold the position as Local Laws Manager, and suffers from a mental illness. </p>\r\n<p>55.&nbsp;The letter set out to respond to proposed amendments to the local laws, and it sought to expose weaknesses but spent considerable time attacking Mr Chafer’s alleged mental state. </p>\r\n<p>56.&nbsp;In my opinion, each of the letters was written on an occasion of qualified privilege. This was conceded by Mr Chafer’s counsel and so found by the Magistrate. </p>\r\n<p>57.&nbsp;The Magistrate, dealing with the three letters together, held that the privileged occasion was “the right of rate payers to publish to the Shire matters relating to land use”. Construed liberally it would embrace any matters relating to land use, which would include questions and criticisms concerning officials performing public duties in respect to land matters, raised with the Shire which employed them. This is a well-recognised category of qualified privilege. However, it is clear from the context that the Magistrate confined the privilege to “matters relating to land use” which did not include raising issues as to the competence and suitability of the Shire’s staff in relation to land use, and whether they should be dismissed. This, in my opinion, led the Magistrate into error. Having made that observation he then considered the issue of malice. “An occasion of qualified privilege must not be used for a purpose or motive foreign to the duty or interest that protects the making of the statement. A purpose or motive that is foreign to the occasion and actuates the making of a statement is called express malice.”[11] </p>\r\n<p>58.&nbsp;The Magistrate said that to call for the sacking of Mr Chafer was evidence of an improper motive. He re-asserted that by noting that the advocating of the dismissal was a purpose foreign to the occasion. Further, he held that the personal attack on Mr Chafer in the third letter was evidence of improper motive. These observations were central to the Magistrate finding that the defence had been defeated by malice. When the purpose of the occasion which is protected by qualified privilege is properly defined, it cannot be said that to question the conduct of a public official, and to raise doubts about his suitability for office raising the question whether he should continue to be employed in that office, is not a purpose or motive foreign to the duty or interest that protects the making of the statement. In my opinion, the Magistrate misdirected himself on the question of malice and his finding must be set aside. The Magistrate also relied upon other evidence of malice, namely, that Mr Tankard was reckless in the use of the words “complained of”, that there was no evidence as to their accuracy, and that he was indifferent to the possible harmful consequences to Mr Chafer’s reputation. Nevertheless it is clear that the Magistrate placed great weight on what he described as evidence of “an improper motive”. In the circumstances his other findings of evidence of malice cannot support his finding, especially as he did not consider malice in respect to each of the separate causes of action. </p>\r\n<p>59.&nbsp;Mr Tankard had the burden of proving that the occasion of publication was protected by qualified privilege. He established the defence in respect to each publication. Whether or not an occasion is one of qualified privilege is a question of law. The principles have been developed by the common law based upon a broad general principle that the common convenience and welfare of society or a general interest of society demands that certain communications should be protected. The circumstances that may constitute a privileged occasion cannot be catalogued. Reference to the well-known text books shows categories of occasions of privileged communication, but the categories are not closed. See Perera v Peiris.[12] The classic statement of the law concerning qualified privilege was stated by Parke B in Toogood v Spyring.[13] </p>\r\n<p>60.&nbsp;There are three broad categories of qualified privilege at common law, namely: <br />(i) where there is a duty, legal, social or moral, resting on the publisher to publish the defamatory words to a publishee who has an interest or a duty in receiving them;<br />(ii) where the publisher in legitimate defence of his own interest publishes the defamatory words to a publishee who has an interest or duty in receiving them;<br />(iii) where the publisher has an interest which corresponds with the interest of the publishee – that is community of interest.</p>\r\n<p>61.&nbsp;It is essential to establish the necessary reciprocity between the publisher and the publishee. Whether a publisher is under a duty was stated by Lindley LJ in Stuart v Bell[14] where his Lordship said: <br />“Would the great mass of right-minded men in the position of the defendant have considered it their duty under the circumstances to make the communication?”</p>\r\n<p>62.&nbsp;Higgins J in Howe v Lees[15] defined interest as:[16] <br />“It is used in the broadest popular sense, as when we say that a man is interested in knowing a fact – not interested in it as a matter of gossip or curiosity, but as a matter of substance apart from its mere quality as news.”</p>\r\n<p>63.&nbsp;As I have stated, reference to the well-known text books illustrates categories of occasions where qualified privilege has been established. I have referred to them above.[17] An example of a communication concerning a public official is Mann v O’Neill[18] where it was accepted that letters to the Federal Attorney-General and Minister of Justice complaining that the plaintiff as special magistrate was suffering from senile dementia were the subject of qualified privilege. The public official category is described in the 5th edition of Odgers on Libel and Slander as follows:[19] <br />“Every communication made with a view to obtain redress for some injury received, or to prevent some public abuse, is privileged, if it be published only to persons who had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint, or power to redress the grievance, or some duty or interest in connection with it.”</p>\r\n<p>64.&nbsp;The learned author notes[20] that it is the duty of all who witness any misconduct on the part of, amongst others, any public officer, to bring such misconduct to the notice of those whose duty it is to enquire into it and if necessary take steps. It is also noted that if the publisher is a person who has been immediately affected by the alleged misconduct, privilege can also be claimed on an occasion where publication is made to explain the effect upon the publisher. In other words, it is accepted that the publisher is acting in self-defence of his own interest. The learned author gives examples of complaints made which were privileged.[21] By way of example, a letter sent to the Post Master General complaining of the misconduct of a post master is privileged if it was written as a bona fide complaint to obtain redress for a grievance that the publisher really believed he had suffered. It was observed in the cases that the particular expressions are not to be too strictly scrutinised if the intention of the defendant was bona fide.[22] In Proctor v Webster[23] the publisher addressed a letter to the body responsible, alleging that a sanitary inspector was corrupt and guilty of misconduct in his office, and it was held that no action lay without proof of malice. In Harrison v Bush[24] the defendant petitioned the Home Secretary stating that a magistrate had made speeches inciting a breach of the peace, requesting an inquiry and that the Home Secretary should remove the plaintiff. It was held the petition was privileged. There are other cases which clearly demonstrate the well-established category of qualified privilege where complaints are made to the proper authority about public officials, persons carrying out statutory powers, persons with responsibilities towards the public and the right of a citizen who is the subject of action by a public official to take steps to defend himself by communicating to the person responsible for the public official. </p>\r\n<p>65.&nbsp;In my opinion, it was these categories of qualified privilege which protected each of the communications by Mr Tankard. By narrowly confining the privileged occasion as the Magistrate did, he fell into error by concluding that calling for Mr Chafer’s dismissal was irrelevant to the occasion and hence was evidence of improper motive. The fitness of Mr Chafer for office as Local Laws Manager was clearly germane and relevant to the privileged occasion when properly defined. </p>\r\n<p>66.&nbsp;The Magistrate placed reliance upon his finding that the avowed acknowledgment that Mr Tankard sought Mr Chafer’s dismissal constituted improper motive. This raises the question of the communication of what appears to be an irrelevant matter on an occasion of qualified privilege. In Adam v Ward[25] it was held that the publication of something which was irrelevant to the subject matter of the privileged occasion was not covered by the privilege. But it is necessary to approach that rule with caution. Whether something is relevant or irrelevant to the privileged occasion is a matter that should not be weighed in nice scales. In Hollocks v Lowe,[26] Lord Diplock stated the test as follows:[27] <br />“As regards the irrelevant matter the test is not whether it is logically relevant but whether, in all the circumstances, it can be inferred that the defendant either did not believe it to be true or, by believing it to be true, realised that it had nothing to do with the particular duty or interest on which the privilege was based, but nevertheless seized the opportunity to drag in irrelevant defamatory matter to vent his personal spite, or for some other improper motive.”</p>\r\n<p>67.&nbsp;As the High Court said in Bellino v ABC[28] the qualified privilege only attaches to that part which is relevant to the privileged occasion. However, the inclusion of an irrelevant part may provide some evidence of malice. </p>\r\n<p>68.&nbsp;It can be seen that there may be a fine line between what is germane to the subject matter and what is completely irrelevant. However, if there is real doubt as to relevancy, it is clear that the use of an occasion to introduce what appears to be irrelevant matters to the subject of the privileged occasion can amount to evidence of malice. In my opinion, the attack upon Mr Chafer in each communication seemed to be germane to the subject matter of each communication. On the other hand it would be open to Mr Chafer to argue on the question of malice that some of the observations made in the last letter were tenuous at best to the relevant subject matter of the communication and amounted to some evidence of malice. </p>\r\n<p>69.&nbsp;In considering the question of malice, the first step in the consideration is to determine the nature and extent of the privilege on the occasion of the publication. Malice is to be determined as at the date of publication. This is the real issue in the proceeding and is a matter that must now be determined. </p>\r\n<p>70.&nbsp;The law concerning malice has been exhaustively summarised in Roberts v Bass in the judgment of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.[29] These principles will guide the Court when determining whether or not Mr Chafer has proven malice to defeat the defence of qualified privilege. </p>\r\n<p>71.&nbsp;At this point, it is appropriate to make a number of observations. First, it is necessary to identify the nature and extent of privileged occasion so that the court can determine what is relevant and germane to the occasion. Secondly, the court must consider the question of malice at the date of publication of each letter. Accordingly, the court could reach the conclusion that malice has been established with respect to the third letter but not the first two letters. Thirdly, the cases show that malice is not easy to establish. The facts in the cases of Horrocks v Lowe,[30] Caldwell v Ipec[31] and Duane v Granrott[32] are examples suggesting actual malice yet the court or the jury held that there was no malice. </p>\r\n<p>72.&nbsp;Fourthly, evidence of malice is divided into two categories. They are intrinsic evidence and extrinsic evidence. The intrinsic evidence is found in the language used by the publisher and may provide evidence that at the relevant time he was actuated by malice. However, a wide latitude is allowed in the choice of words used. “At common law it has been repeatedly said that a court should not be quick to find evidence of malice in the terms of defamatory material published on a privileged occasion because so to do would restrict considerably, if not defeat, the protection which the law confers on privileged occasions. It has been said where the words are utterly disproportionate to the facts, this amounts to evidence of malice, presumably on the footing that the extremity and exaggeration of language is explicable only by reference to the existence of ill-will in the defendant, but it does not suggest a defendant is confined to saying what is strictly necessary to the occasion ... Nonetheless it is impossible to formulate a precise and illuminating criterion which will separate those publications which furnish extrinsic evidence of ill-will from those which do not”.[33] (Emphases added). </p>\r\n<p>73.&nbsp;One has to be careful to not infer malice because the words used are exaggerated, hard hitting, spiteful or harsh. “In such cases no matter how harsh, hasty, untrue, or libellous the publication would be but for the circumstances, the law declares it privileged because the amount of public inconvenience from the restriction of freedom of speech or writing would far outbalance that arising from the infliction of a private injury.”[34] </p>\r\n<p>74.&nbsp;Finally, extrinsic evidence is any evidence as to the state of mind of the publisher showing that he was actuated by express malice at the time of publication. </p>\r\n<p>75.&nbsp;The evidence would include circumstances of the publication, evidence of the publisher’s conduct on other occasions, the conduct of the publisher during the period of the litigation and any evidence of improper motive or lack of honest belief. </p>\r\n<p>76.&nbsp;Because the Magistrate misdirected himself on the issue of malice, the orders must be set aside. Before I state what should be done in this appeal, I wish to make brief comments on the other two points of law raised. </p>\r\n<p>Interest on judgment<br />77.&nbsp;The Magistrate ordered Mr Tankard to pay $22,819.70 interest on the damages awarded. It appears from the calculation sheets handed to Mr Tankard that interest was calculated from the date of the first letter. It appears that Mr Chafer’s counsel claimed that interest was to be awarded from the date of publication of the defamatory matter until the date of judgment. Reference was made to David Syme &amp; Co Ltd v Mather[35] and John Fairfax v Kelly.[36] The first case makes no mention of such a principle and the second case was based upon a New South Wales Act which provided for interest from the date when the cause of action accrued. That is not the law in this State. Section 100(7) of the Magistrates’ Court Act deals with interest on the judgment debt from the time the order was made but not before. The jurisdiction to award damages in the nature of interest on an order made for damages in the Magistrates’ Court is given by s33 of the Supreme Court Act 1986. The section provides that the rules of law enacted in Part 5 of that Act apply to inferior courts and accordingly ss58-60 of the Supreme Court Act apply to the Magistrates’ Court. Section 60(1) requires the Court to award damages in the nature of interest from the commencement of the proceeding until judgment. Interest is awarded from the commencement of the proceeding, and the Court must fix the rate of interest, which must not exceed the rate fixed from time to time under the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983. It is noted that there is a penalty component which in most cases is applied but there may be exceptions where it would be unjust to impose the penalty. The purpose of the penalty is to encourage settlement. The order made was wrong. Interest should have been calculated from the date the proceeding was commenced. </p>\r\n<p>Costs<br />78.&nbsp;Mr Tankard has alleged that he was denied natural justice on the question of costs. It is unnecessary for the Court to answer this point of law. However, I wish to make some observations about the costs order. It appears that when the reasons were given, counsel for Mr Chafer asked for costs. A number of sheets of calculations were handed to Mr Tankard and the Court. The calculations set out the items and the amounts claimed in accordance with the Magistrates’ Court Civil Procedure Scale. Item 21 dealt with counsel’s brief fee which in respect to the scale up to $40,000 was $1,311. The brief fee covered the first six hours of hearing. The costs scale fixed the sum of $872 for every six hours at court thereafter. The sheets then sought the following: <br />“Add loadings in accordance with Supreme Court and County Court practice:<br />Counsel’s fees at $2,700 per day X 10 = $27,000. <br />79.&nbsp;Evidently the Magistrate in his discretion acceded to that submission and awarded the sum of $2,700 a day but also allowed the original brief fee of $1,311 and $872 for each day. It followed that the brief fee was allowed at $4,011 plus refreshers of $3,572. The point of law does not attack the costs order made but raises the question of the denial of natural justice. Evidence was placed before this Court which makes it extremely difficult to determine what happened which led to these costs orders for counsel’s fees. It was asserted from the Bar table that there was an offer of compromise made by Mr Chafer but that was not placed before this Court. There is no evidence that the Magistrate pointed out to Mr Tankard that the application to order counsel’s fees, in effect nearly four times the scale costs, was an unusual application and the Magistrate would have been assisted by Mr Tankard making submissions. Because there is inadequate material I do not wish to say anything more about the question. However, I wish to make a number of general observations about the fees. Order 26 of the Magistrates’ Court Rules requires the court to fix the costs of any complaint on the day the complaint is heard and determined.[37] Rule 26.02(1) requires the court to fix the costs in accordance with the scale of costs being Appendix A to the Rules. That paragraph lays down the general rule that must be complied with. The scale costs are determined and fixed, and when parties go to court a plaintiff expects to recover those costs if successful and an unsuccessful defendant expects that the costs will be fixed in accordance with the scale. There is power under Rule 26.02(2) for the court if it thinks “that any item in the scale is inadequate or excessive”, to allow a greater or lesser sum than the scale provides. Counsels’ fees are fixed in the Rules as a proper remuneration to counsel for preparation and appearance which is involved in the brief fee and the subsequent refresher fee. If a party wishes to engage counsel who charges above the scale fee, that is a right that the party has but the exercise of that right does not impose an obligation upon the unsuccessful party to pay that barrister’s fee. An item in the scale may be inadequate taking into account the complexity of the case. The complexity may arise because of the law or the facts or both.[38] The magistrate must make some assessment of the time that would be involved by counsel in preparing the brief for hearing. But the brief fee includes the preparation by counsel. Counsel as a general rule should not be paid more for learning the law which he or she should know. As a general rule, the Magistrates’ Court should be slow to increase the scale fees because the court thinks the item is inadequate. The scale costs and fees should be the norm. To counsel unfamiliar with the law of defamation, a defamation proceeding will require more time to prepare. On the other hand, experienced counsel in the field would spend less time. But it is not a basis for increasing the inexperienced counsel’s fee because he or she had to spend more time researching the law and preparing the case. The Magistrates’ Court is the court in this state dealing with claims of lesser monetary value than in the higher courts, and the costs should not be at a level which deters litigants. Further, defendants defend proceedings in the expectation that the costs will be determined in accordance with the scale of costs. I have difficulty in accepting that it was reasonable in this proceeding for the Magistrate to order that Mr Tankard should pay Mr Chafer’s counsel the sum of $4,011 brief fee and a daily fee thereafter of $3,572. The proceeding was not heard in the County Court or the Supreme Court. The fees were incurred in a Magistrates’ Court proceeding. I should add that if there was an offer of compromise by Mr Chafer which was less than the amount ordered, it is still difficult to accept that the order for counsel’s fees was a proper order. </p>\r\n<p>Remit to Magistrates’ Court<br />80.&nbsp;On an appeal from a decision of the Magistrates’ Court, this Court has wide powers as to the outcome of the appeal.[39] This Court may make “such order as it thinks appropriate”. In my opinion, the Court should strive on a successful appeal to finalise the proceeding as expeditiously and as inexpensively as can be achieved, consistent with the dictates of justice. The effect of setting aside the orders for damages, interest and costs, leaves the questions of malice defeating the defence of qualified privilege in respect of each communication, and if Mr Chafer is successful, the assessment of damages in respect of each cause of action which has succeeded, to be determined. As the Magistrate did not deal with each cause of action separately, it is impossible to say what amount of damages was attributable to each communication. In addition, the Magistrate awarded aggravated damages but did not specify what proportion of the damages was increased by aggravation. In the course of this appeal, the Court raised with counsel the possibility of the parties agreeing on the amount of damages in relation to each cause of action. </p>\r\n<p>81.&nbsp;This Court cannot determine the issues of malice, and if successful, the amount of damages. The proceeding was heard over nine days and the Magistrate heard from a number of witnesses. There is no transcript of that evidence before this Court. Even taking into account the findings made by the Magistrate, it is impossible for this Court to determine the issue of actual malice in relation to each publication. Accordingly, it is necessary to remit the proceeding back to the Magistrates’ Court. This proceeding to date has resulted in substantial legal costs, and the Court should strive to minimise any further court proceedings consistent with the dictates of justice. However, the matter has to be remitted for further consideration by a magistrate. The Court has requested the parties to agree on the amount of damages in respect to each cause of action. If that cannot be agreed, then it will be necessary for the Magistrates’ Court to determine the question of malice and, if Mr Chafer is successful in respect to any cause of action, the assessment of the damages. </p>\r\n<p>82.&nbsp;The Court discussed with counsel the question of remitting the matter back to the Magistrate who heard the proceeding. Counsel for Mr Chafer submitted that the Court should do this in order to avoid a further protracted hearing, whereas counsel for Mr Tankard opposed the course. A number of issues arose. The first and most pressing is whether the Magistrate would be in a position, based upon memory, his notes (if he has retained them), the exhibits, and his reasons, to be able to make a determination in accordance with the law after hearing submissions from the parties. In order to determine whether the Magistrate could discharge his duty the Court requested the Magistrate to furnish a report pursuant to Rule 58.14 of the Rules of this Court. The Magistrate furnished a report and he informed the Court that he was not confident that his memory or notes were “sufficiently reliable to consider the issue of malice on the evidence that has already been given.” My provisional view is that the proceeding should be remitted to another magistrate, but I will give the parties the opportunity to further address me on the topic. If that outcome is adopted it avoids the Court grappling with the difficult question of remitting the proceeding to the Magistrate and whether this is fair in the circumstances. The perception of justice is as important as justice actually being done. There was an argument that because the Magistrate had awarded interest which was contrary to the law and arguably awarded far too much for counsels’ fees with a real probability that he mistakenly doubled up the fee, there was the perception that Mr Tankard may not have received a fair go. I am not for one minute suggesting that that be so, but it is the perception which is the important element rather than the reality when deciding what course to follow. </p>\r\n<p>83.&nbsp;It therefore follows that subject to further argument the proceeding will have to be remitted back to a different magistrate to decide whether or not at the relevant time Mr Tankard was actuated by malice in respect to each cause of action. Each side will be at liberty to place evidence before the Court on the question. I would encourage them to agree on the evidence which has been given to date on the issue and the findings of the Magistrate which are relevant. An order will be made that the proceeding be remitted to the Magistrates’ Court to decide the outstanding issues in accordance with the reasons for judgment. I will hear the parties on the form of order. Hopefully the parties can agree on the question of damages so that the issue is confined to the question of malice. Further, I will hear the parties on the question of costs of the appeal and the costs of the earlier proceeding. </p>\r\n<p>84.&nbsp;Subject to any submissions I propose to make the following orders on this appeal: <br />(i) That the appeal be allowed.<br />(ii) That the orders made by Magistrate Barrett on 19 December 2003 of $40,000 damages, damages in the nature of interest and costs, be set aside.<br />(iii) That the proceeding be remitted to the Magistrates’ Court for further hearing by a different magistrate to determine the outstanding issues as a result of the appeal, namely the issues of malice and damages.<br />(iv) That the plaintiff-respondent pay the appellant-defendant’s costs of this appeal including reserved costs.<br />(v) That the costs of the proceeding before Magistrate Barrett in November/December 2003 be costs to be determined by the magistrate hearing the remitted proceeding.<br />(vi) That the respondent to the appeal be granted an indemnity certificate pursuant to s4(1) of the Appeal Costs Act 1998.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See s109(4) and (5). <br />[2] See S.R.

As the penalties were not paid, a courtesy letter was sent giving further time to pay or to complete a statutory declaration "stating the name and address of the person who was in charge of the motor vehicle at the relevant time". Declarations were completed indicating that the "actual driver" was a company named KC Management Services Pty Ltd. The Council refused to accept this nomination and subsequently the matter came on for hearing before a magistrate. The magistrate held that EP/L had complied with the statutory provision and as a result was not guilty of the offences. Upon appeal—</p>\r\n<p><strong>HELD: Appeal allowed.<br />1.&nbsp;The critical question was whether a body corporate could be the "person in charge of a motor vehicle" for the purposes of s86(3) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986 (Act). It is well established that courts should try to avoid a construction of the Act that would produce absurd or unjust consequences. If "person in charge of the vehicle" could be interpreted in the relevant section to cover a body corporate which was not the owner but was the employer of the driver that would result in the owner of the vehicle and the actual driver escaping liability. <br />2.&nbsp;Addressing the purpose of the provisions, it appears reasonably clear that the intention was to overcome the difficulty of proving the identity of the individual responsible by making the owner liable and imposing the burden upon the owner to identify the actual offender. The intention is reasonably clear that the ultimate choice of the person to bear the penalty lies between the owner and the person in actual control of the motor vehicle at the time of the offence.<br />3.&nbsp;One of the objectives of any regulatory system which imposes penalties for breaches of the system is to deter people from breaching the regulations. The interpretation advanced by EP/L could significantly diminish the deterrent effect because actual drivers could avoid the consequences of their actions. That would be undesirable. Also EP/Ls submission may also have the undesirable result that s86(2) would not protect the company nominated in the present case from further penalty even if the owner or actual offender had paid the full amount of the penalty. <br />4.&nbsp;A further relevant consideration is that the construction advanced by EP/L introduces complications into what is otherwise a relatively simple system and it would be surprising if, bearing in mind the nature of the system, it was intended to introduce any complications such as those advanced by EP/L. Its construction also opens up opportunities for evasion. <br />5.&nbsp;On proper analysis, there is no ambiguity in the expression "person in charge". It is a reference to the individual in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence is committed. In those circumstances a corporation cannot be "in charge". Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed.<br /><br />SMITH J:<br />Background to the appeal <br />1.</strong>&nbsp;In March 2004, parking infringement notices were affixed on four separate occasions to the windscreen of a green 1997 Mercedes Benz sedan registered in the name of Eurodynamics Pty Ltd (the respondent). On three of those occasions the offence specified was breach of Road Rule 205 – that the vehicle had been parked for a period longer than that indicated. On the other occasion, the offence alleged was breach of Road Rule 179 (1) – that the vehicle had been stopped in a loading zone.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;In each case, the respondent did not respond to the notice or pay the penalty within the time specified and as a result a courtesy letter was sent to the respondent in accordance with Schedule 7 to the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 in respect of the parking infringement notices. The courtesy letter gave the respondent 28 days in which to pay the penalty and costs or to complete a statutory declaration "stating the name and address of the person who was in charge of the motor vehicle at the relevant time".<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The respondent took up the latter alternative and through a Mr Mick Petrovitch returned statutory declarations declaring that at the time of the relevant offences Eurodynamics Pty Ltd was not "driving the vehicle" and that the "actual driver" was K C Management Services Pty Ltd. The quoted expressions appear in the standard form to which Mr Petrovitch responded. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;This nomination was unacceptable to the Council and it advised the respondent that it did not accept a company as being responsible for the parking infringement notice and requiring Mr Petrovitch to submit the name of the individual who was in charge of the vehicle at the time of the infringement. The respondent did not reply to that letter.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;The Council then registered the parking infringement notices with the PERIN Court pursuant to Schedule 7 to the <em>Magistrates Court Act </em>1989. Enforcement orders were made in respect of the notices. Mr Petrovitch then applied to revoke the enforcement orders filing statutory declarations maintaining the position stated in the previous statutory declaration that the respondent was not "the person who committed the offence" and that the "vehicle" was driven by K C Management Services Pty Ltd". The orders were revoked. The Council then successfully applied to have the matters referred to the Magistrates’ Court.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The hearing of the proceedings took place on 5 May 2005. It is common ground that the respondent owner would be deemed guilty in relation to each of the contraventions unless s86(3) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>applied. That section is in the following terms:<br />"86(3) Despite sub-sections (1) and (2), the owner of the vehicle is not by virtue of this section guilty of an offences if<br />(a) before or within 28 days after service of the owner of—<br />(i) . . . <br />(iii) a courtesy letter under Schedule 7 to the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989—<br />. . . in respect of the parking infringement concerned the owner supplies to an enforcement official in a sworn statement in writing or in a statutory declaration the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the relevant time."<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate held that the respondent had complied with that provision and as a result was not guilty of an offence. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant appeals from that decision. <br /><strong>The issue <br />9.</strong>&nbsp;It is common ground that the question of law that is raised in this appeal is the same as that which was raised below, namely, whether by nominating KC Management Services Pty Ltd as the driver, the respondent complied with s86(3)(a) of the 1986 Act by supplying: "to an enforcement official ... in a statutory declaration the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the relevant time."<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate stated the following conclusions on this issue:<br />"There seems to be no reason why, and in fact it appears to be countenanced by the legislation, that a corporation can be the nominated person pursuant to a statutory declaration. There is no limit in the way that the Act is constructed, that is the <em>Road Safety Act</em>, to a person who is in fact driving. It would have been easy, if that was the intent of Parliament, to in fact allow a prosecuting authority to pursue a driver for 86(3) to demand of the owner that the name and address of the person who was driving the motor vehicle most recently at the relevant time would be declared. Of course when a car is parked, there is no necessity for a driver to be present at all. <br />So I can’t understand how it can be said as a matter of law that a nomination of a corporation is anything but a proper nomination. This matter is only contested upon that issue. The corporation in my view has failed to act upon an appropriate nomination pursuant to s86(3)."<br /><strong>Common ground <br />11.</strong>&nbsp;The critical issue in the appeals is whether a body corporate can be the "person in charge of a motor vehicle" for the purposes of s86(3)(a) of the Act. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;It was common ground that the starting point for considering that question is s38 Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984. It provides so far as relevant:<br />"In all Acts and subordinate instruments, unless the contrary intention appears— <br />... ‘person’ includes a body politic or corporate as well as an individual;"<br />It is also common ground that the issue is to be approached by asking the question whether the contrary intention appears. In approaching that question, the respondent identified the following principles that can be distilled from the judgment of McGarvie J in <em>Gibbs v Clarke</em>,[1] namely:<br />"• it is as if the provision in the Interpretation of Legislation Act is in the interpretation section of the act; <br />• every part of the Act is to be construed with reference to the other parts of the Act; <br />• where alternative constructions are open, the alternative is to be chosen which is consistent with the smooth workings of the system which the statute purports to be regulating; <br />• the approach is to regard the word "person" as including a corporation unless the Act as a whole shows, with reasonable clarity, that it is intended that the word does not include a corporation.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;It is in the exploration of the question of whether a contrary intention appears, that the parties diverge in their submissions. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In support of its position, the appellant Council relied on an analysis of the following: <br />• the subject matter of the provision;<br />• the context in which the provision is to be read – the section and Act as a whole;<br />• the purpose of the provision; and <br />• avoiding absurd or unjust consequences. <br /><strong>Submissions – subject matter of the provision <br />15.</strong>&nbsp;Relying principally upon the analysis of the Queensland Court of Appeal in <em>Ringelstein v Redford Cattle Co Pty Ltd</em>[2] the appellant submitted that the concept of being "in charge of" a motor vehicle is an essentially practical one that is concerned with the question of actual control not theoretical control. It quoted the following passage from Ringelstein[3]<br />"It is difficult to perceive why theoretical control should be introduced into the essentially practical concept of being "in charge of" a motor vehicle, and there is nothing in the language or apparent policy of the provisions in the <em>Motor Vehicles Insurance Act </em>in which the phrase is used to require or support such a conclusion. While a person may be "in charge of" a motor vehicle although not at the time driving it ..., the concept of "being in charge" is less concerned with legal authority than with physical control. Indeed, the legislative use of the phrase in that sense in connection with the motor vehicle is well established in Queensland and elsewhere."<br />Counsel for the appellant submitted that only a natural person can physically control a motor car. A body corporate cannot drive a car or park a car. Counsel submitted that a body corporate cannot leave a car parked in a space for longer than the lawful limit or park it in a loading zone. Only a natural person can do that. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel also submitted that the concept of being "in charge of" a vehicle requires actual control. Counsel referred to discussion, for example, in <em>Haines v Roberts</em>[4] where Lord Goddard commented that where a person leaves a car outside a hotel and asks a friend to take the car home, "he has put it in charge of somebody else, but if he has not put the vehicle in charge of somebody else he is in charge of it until he does so". Similar sentiments were repeated in <em>Woodage v Jones</em>.[5] The same distinction was drawn in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Watkins </em>where it was said:<br />"Usually such a defendant will be prima facie in charge unless he has put the vehicle in someone else’s charge. However, he would not be so if in all the circumstances he has ceased to be in actual control and there is no realistic possibility of his resuming actual control while unfit, eg if he is at home in bed for the night, if he is a great distance from the car or if it is taken by another."<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the respondent submitted that limited assistance can be derived from judicial definitions of "person in charge of a motor vehicle" in other contexts. Counsel referred to the words of caution in <em>Ogden Industries Pty Ltd v Lucas</em>.[6] In particular, counsel referred to those authorities that had interpreted the expression in the context of drink driving and argued that plainly a corporation cannot be in control of a vehicle for the purposes of engaging in driving under the influence of alcohol but that that is a different situation. Counsel submitted that a company can be guilty of an offence under s86(1). Counsel referred to the fact that the word "owner" is defined in s85 of the Act as "the person in whose name the motor vehicle is registered at the time of the offence under this Act". Counsel also drew attention to Regulation 201 of the <em>Road Safety Vehicles Regulations </em>1999 (Vic) which provides:<br />"A person is eligible to be the registered operator of a vehicle if <br />(a) that person is—<br />... <br />(ii) a corporation; and<br />(b) the vehicle is owned by, or is under the management of, that person."<br />Counsel argued that it is clear, therefore, that the registered operator of a vehicle can be a corporation and therefore an owner of the vehicle for the purposes of s86 of the 1986 Act. That much, of course, is common ground. Counsel submitted that the fact that a corporation can be liable for a parking infringement under s86 does not evince a contrary intention that a corporation cannot be nominated under s86(3) rather it evinces an intention that it can be nominated. That, however, is the issue to be determined. <br /><strong>Submissions on the interpretation of the provisions in the context of the legislation <br />18.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the appellant submitted that reading s86(3)(a) in the context of s86 as a whole supported the conclusion it advanced. He noted that s86(1) provides that the owner of the vehicle is guilty of an offence "as if that person had been the actual offender who was guilty of the infringement" – unless the court is satisfied the vehicle was stolen or the plates were stolen. Counsel then drew attention to s86(2) which provided that sub-section 86(1) did not affect the liability of the "actual offender" but went on to provide that where the penalty has been paid by "the actual offender or owner" then no further penalty can be imposed or recovered from "the owner or actual offender". Turning to s86(3) counsel emphasised the fact that the person to be nominated is the person "who was in charge at the relevant time". Counsel submitted that the reference to relevant time was significant and required attention to focus on who was in actual control of the car when the parking infringement occurred – not who was in theoretical control of the vehicle generally. Counsel further submitted that having regard to the intention revealed in s86(1) and s86(2), the scheme required the reference to the person "in charge of the vehicle" to be the actual offender responsible for the parking infringement. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the respondent submitted that it was significant that different expressions had been used in other parts of the legislation where the same expression might well have been used. Counsel referred to the use of the word "individual" in juxtaposition with bodies corporate and entities and instead of "person".[7] <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel also referred to the use of the expression "natural person" instead of "person" in s138(2) of the Act limiting the use of information obtained from a "natural person" in criminal proceedings against that person. Counsel also drew attention to situations where the word "person" is used to include corporations.[8] <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel submitted that Parliament having used in the same Act the word "individual" or "natural person", and having not done so in s86(3) itself, an intention contrary to the proposition that "person" include a corporation does not appear in the Act. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the respondent also argued that the use of the expression "person in charge of a motor vehicle" in other parts of the Act had to be confined to natural persons because only a natural person could breach or comply with the provision. Examples given included the duty to stop the motor vehicle if requested imposed on the driver or person in charge,[9] the statutory definition in s3AA of the Act of persons in charge (non exhaustive),[10] the obligation to have a licence in his or her possession when driving or in charge of a vehicle,[11] inspecting a vehicle when the driver or person apparently in charge is present[12] and the obligation on an inspector to supply name, rank and place of duty in certain circumstances to the driver or person apparently in charge.[13] <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;I note that in relation to s3AA of the 1986 Act, counsel for the appellant submitted that while it did not give an exhaustive list it, nonetheless, focussed on actual control. Counsel for the respondent referred to authority from the area of Customs law and in particular the case of <em>Sheen v G O Cornish Pty Ltd.[</em>14] In that case the question arose whether certain provisions enabling the dismissal of charges that had been proved applied to corporations as well as natural persons Begg J held that some of the provisions could be applied to corporations while others could not. Counsel submitted that similarly under the Act, merely because a corporation cannot do some of the things set out in, for example, s3AA does not mean that a corporation can never be in charge of a vehicle. Counsel referred, for example, to the position of a vehicle left in a no standing zone by an employee of a corporation in the course of his employment with the intention that another employee of the same corporation was to collect the vehicle and take it elsewhere in the course of his employment. Counsel argued that the corporation would be regarded as being in charge of the vehicle in those circumstances. As to this example there is, in my view, an alternative argument, namely that the first employee remains in charge until the next takes over. It is not necessary to interpret s3AA to apply to corporations to give it a satisfactory operation. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the respondent further submitted that the expression "person in charge" was at worst from his client’s point of view ambiguous and in those circumstances any real ambiguity persisting after the application of the ordinary rules of construction should be resolved in favour of the most lenient construction.[15] <br /><strong>Submissions as to the purpose of the provisions <br />25.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant submitted that the purpose of s86(3) is to allow the owner of the motor vehicle to avoid liability for a parking infringement by nominating the actual offender whose acts or omissions caused the infringement. It was submitted that this analysis is supported by the legislative history. It appears that s86 of the Act was introduced to deal with traffic and parking problems which were emerging in the City of Melbourne at the time. At the time the legislation provided only that the owner was liable unless the car had been stolen or illegally used. This was seen as being too onerous on owners of vehicles. Counsel referred to Hansard quoting from the speech of Mr Rylah who was then in opposition, and his concerns about the limited nature of the protection given to owners and his emphasis that relief needed to be given to the innocent owner. Mr Rylah concluded:<br />"We believe that the terms should not be so drastic, and that if an owner supplies the name of the person in charge of the vehicle or satisfies the court that he was not the driver at the time and did not know the name of the driver he should not be responsible for the offence."<br />It was put that ultimately, the Bill was amended to address these issues in the terminology that is now found there.<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Relying on this material, counsel submitted that the Act was amended to ensure that the owner of the vehicle could avoid liability for a parking infringement by nominating the actual offender or the real culprit whose action or inaction caused the parking infringement. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel also sought to rely upon the comparison with s66 of the Act which deals with prescribed offences detected by a photographic detection device and also provides an owner onus regime. In those provisions, however, the word "driver" and "driving" is used. The argument is double-edged because those words are not used in s86. The offences in the rules to which the section relates, however, refer to the offender as the "driver".[16<br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel also drew attention to the explanatory memorandum relating to amendments to s86 that came into effect in 2004. Amendments were made to s86 dealing, among other things, with the time in which the nomination should take place, the range of people to whom the person served with the parking infringement notice may give the nomination and the evidentiary consequences of the notice. In the discussion in the explanatory memorandum, reference is made on a number of occasions to the "actual driver" when referring to the person who could be nominated as the person who infringed the provisions. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;In addressing the issue of the purpose of the provisions, counsel for the respondent submitted that if it was intended to limit the class of persons to be nominated to the "offender", that term could have been used. Counsel also submitted that s86(3)(ab) revealed an expectation that there would be more than one nomination. Counsel also drew attention to the fact that the Act was intended to operate in a variety of circumstances including the circumstance where a company who owned the vehicle may have leased it to another company. Counsel also referred to a situation of companies who hire out vehicles. In many instances, it would not be possible it was argued, for the company that owned the vehicle to be able to identify the individual and in those circumstances it could only nominate the leasing or hiring company as the person in charge. It may be said, however, that the company that leases the vehicle will normally be identified as the company managing the vehicle for the purpose of registration[17] and so any infringement notice will be served on that company. As for the hiring of vehicles, the company hiring out the vehicle will normally have personal details of persons who will be driving the vehicle. <br /><strong>Submissions of parties – avoiding absurd or unjust consequences <br />30.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was well established that courts should try to avoid a construction of the Act that would produce absurd or unjust consequences. Counsel quoted Gibbs J[18] <br />"Where two meanings are open . . . it is proper to adopt that meaning that will avoid consequences that appear irrational and unjust."<br />Counsel submitted that if "person in charge of the vehicle" could be interpreted in the relevant section to cover a body corporate which was not the owner but which was, for example, the employer of the driver, you would have the result that the owner of the vehicle would escape liability and the actual driver would escape liability. Further, the company nominated would escape liability because it could not be prosecuted under the road rules because the relevant road rules define the offence in terms of the "driver" not the person in charge. Counsel submitted that it followed that if the "person in charge of the vehicle" could be a body corporate the parking infringements in a case like the present would always remain unpunished. Counsel also submitted that it followed that nominating a body corporate as the person in charge could be used as a device to avoid paying parking fines. Counsel submitted that such a construction should be avoided. <br /><strong>Analysis <br />31.</strong>&nbsp;Bearing in mind that a corporation can only act through its servants and agents and, through them, can commit offences, the critical question is whether there is revealed an intention to exclude, from the concept of "person in charge" a corporation whose servant or agent is in actual control of the vehicle. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, the expression "person in charge of a motor vehicle at the relevant time" read literally is referring to a person with the actual control of a motor vehicle at a particular point in time. If that be the correct construction a corporation cannot be "in charge". <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;Such a construction of the expression "in charge of" in the context of other offences appears to be of longstanding.[19] While the context of parking offences is different, it would be surprising if such an expression was intended to have a different meaning and include those not in actual control but in a theoretical position to exercise control – such as the owner or corporate employer. If it was intended to have such a meaning, there would arguably have been no need to specifically refer to the owner. These views are strengthened by consideration of the immediate context in which they are found. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;In s86 itself a clear dichotomy is provided between the owner and the actual offender in sub-sections (1) and (2) and the scheme of the provisions is that either the owner or the actual offender will be liable for the penalty. These are the primary provisions:-<br />"(1) The owner of a vehicle in relation to which a parking infringement occurs is guilty of an offence against the Act, rule, regulation or by-law contravened, in all respects as if that person had been the actual offender who was guilty of the infringement, unless the court is satisfied that the vehicle was a stolen vehicle or that the number plates displayed on the vehicle were stolen <br />(2) Sub-section (1) does not affect the liability of the actual offender, but where the full amount of any penalty has been paid by the actual offender or owner in relation to any parking infringement (whether pursuant to section 89 or on the order of the Magistrates’ Court) no further penalty may be imposed on or recovered from the owner or actual offender in relation to that infringement."<br />Section 86 (3) is a subsidiary provision qualifying the operation of sub-sections (1) and (2). <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;It is reasonably clear that Parliament was seeking to draw a distinction between the owner and the offender, who is the person who was actually in control. Bearing in mind that the owner could be said to be in charge of the vehicle vicariously through its servants or agents, it would seem reasonably clear that Parliament was intending to use the concept of "person in charge" to focus on the individual who was actually in control of the vehicle at the relevant time rather than any employer or principal or other intermediary. <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;Looking at the Act as a whole, different terminology, identified by counsel,[20] is used. But the context generally explains the choice of words. For example, when setting out different penalties for corporations and individuals, it was inappropriate to use "person". On the other hand, the definition of "registered proprietor" uses the expression "person responsible" rather than "person in charge" – consistently with the appellant’s construction. The list in s3AA is also consistent with that construction. In the end, an examination of the rest of the Act is inconclusive. The immediate context of s86, however, strongly supports the interpretation advanced by the appellant. <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;Addressing the purpose of the provisions,[21] it appears reasonably clear that the intention was to overcome the difficulty of proving the identity of the individual responsible by making the owner liable and imposing the burden upon the owner to identify the actual offender. It is true that the legislation now accepts that there may be a chain of people between the owner and the actual offender.[22] That is consistent with the need to make provision for inaccurate nominations. But even there the intention is reasonably clear that the ultimate choice of the person to bear the penalty lies between the owner and the person in actual control of the motor vehicle at the time of the offence. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;A further point to be borne in mind is that as one of the objectives of any regulatory system which imposes penalties for breaches of the system is to deter people from breaching the regulations. The interpretation advanced by the respondent could significantly diminish the deterrent effect because actual drivers could avoid the consequences of their actions. That would be undesirable. I note also that the respondent’s construction may also have the undesirable result that s86(2) would not protect the company nominated in the present case from further penalty even if the owner or actual offender had paid the full amount of the penalty. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;A further relevant consideration is that the construction advanced by the respondent introduces complications into what is otherwise a relatively simple system and it would be surprising if, bearing in mind the nature of the system, it was intended to introduce any complications such as those advanced for the respondent. Its construction also opens up opportunities for evasion. <br /><strong>Conclusion <br />40.</strong>&nbsp;On proper analysis, there is no ambiguity in the expression "person in charge". It is a reference to the individual in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence is committed. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] [1985] VR 778. <br />[2] [1995] 1 QDR 433, 436; <em>WorkCover Queensland v Suncorp Metway Insurance Ltd </em>[2005] QCA 155 at [1], [34] – [37] and [55]. <br />[3] ibid <br />[4] [1953] 1 OR ER 344, 345. <br />[5] (No 2) [1975] RTR 119. <br />[6] [1970] AC 113, 127. <br />[7] S3, definition of body corporate and home address; s7(3) and 95(3)(f) which set out different penalties for "individuals" and bodies corporate; and the use of "individual" in s135. <br />[8] S3, Definition of registered operator (note the "person responsible"), s16C(1)(b) referring to a person who was the registered operator; s85 defining owner in terms of "a person who . . .", s 93 relating to the service of notices of "any person". <br />[9] S59. <br />[10] S3AA. <br />[11] S19(5). <br />[12] S116(1). <br />[13] S117(3). <br />[14] (1978) 22 ALR 155. <br />[15] <em>Deming No 456 Pty Ltd v Brisbane Unit Development Corporation Pty Ltd</em> (1983) 155 CLR 129. <br />[16] <em>Road Rules – Victoria</em>, Part 12. <br />[17] <em>Road Safety (Vehicles) Regulations </em>1999 Reg 201 and s85 Definitions of the Act. <br />[18] <em>Public Transport Commission (NSW) v J Murray Moore </em>(NSW) Pty Ltd (1975) 132 CLR 336 at 350. <br />[19] See above. <br />[20] See above. <br />[21] <em>Interpretation of Legislation Act </em>1984, s35. <br />[22] 86(3) (ab).<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the appellant Melbourne City Council: Mr J Pizer, counsel.

The dismissal of the counterclaim is not explicable on the basis of an implied finding of contributory negligence on the part of R. Even if the cost of the replacement engine were to be ignored, the evidence as to the cost of the parts purchased by R. to carry out the wasted repairs would appear to have supported either a small order in relation to the claim (which is not the subject of the appeal) or a small order in relation to the counterclaim.<br /><br />WILLIAMS J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;This is an appeal from the dismissal of a counterclaim in the Magistrates’ Court at Korumburra on 1 July 2005.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;By a Complaint, filed on 27 August 2003, the respondent ("Mr Webb") had claimed the sum of $5,498.67, being a debt of $5,315.19, together with interest, from the appellant ("Mr Roumeliotis") in relation to work and labour done when repairing Mr Roumeliotis’s fishing boat in May 2002. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;By a Notice of Defence, filed on 21 October 2003, Mr Roumeliotis admitted that, on or about 7 May 2003, Mr Webb undertook mechanical work and labour on his behalf "to the sum of $5,315.19 to a boat engine". Mr Roumeliotis denied his indebtedness, claiming to have suffered loss and damage, and foreshadowed a counterclaim in relation to Mr Webb’s alleged negligence. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;By Particulars of Counterclaim, filed on 4 October 2004, Mr Roumeliotis alleged that Mr Webb had breached an implied term of the agreement by failing to carry out the repairs with due care and skill. He alleged that he suffered loss and damage, being the cost of a replacement engine, lost income and the cost of wages. Abandoning the excess of his claim, Mr Roumeliotis sought damages in the sum of $40,000 by the counterclaim. <br /><strong>Background <br />5.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Roumeliotis carried on a fishing business. His boat engine needed to be repaired after it had failed at sea during a fishing trip. He arranged for Mr Webb, a motor mechanic, to come to his boat to assess the situation and it was agreed that Mr Webb should "patch up" the engine, so that Mr Roumeliotis and his crew could return to sea. The engine was repaired and it failed again, after a subsequent trip. Eventually, it was replaced by a third party, at a cost of $15,625 to Mr Roumeliotis. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;At the hearing, Mr Webb and Mr Roumeliotis each gave evidence. Each called a witness to the conversation between them which took place on the fishing boat, before the repairs were carried out. There was evidence from Mr Webb that he had provided an estimate of the cost of rebuilding the engine at a sum in the vicinity of $17,500. Mr Roumeliotis gave evidence that he had spent "close to $6,000" for the parts used by Mr Webb in the repairs. Counsel for Mr Webb told the Court that an invoice for $3,789.76 relating to the purchase of parts was tendered in the Magistrates’ Court[1]. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Roumeliotis also adduced evidence from an expert witness, Mr David Padfield, to the effect that the boat engine failure was caused by a split in the hose attached to the reservoir in the cooling system. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate’s reasons are recorded in the transcript, immediately after a reference to the withdrawal of the last witness and concessions by counsel for Mr Roumeliotis and Mr Webb’s solicitor, to the effect that the issue for the court was one of fact and that no legal submissions were to be made. The transcript continues:<br />"His Honour: Well, I find both the plaintiff and the defendant not to be truly creditable or credible witnesses. Let me say that from the outset, I do accept some of the evidence from both of them but not all from either of them. In relation to Mr Webb, while Mr Webb was giving his evidence I must say that I was thinking that if I sat here today as a coroner which I often do, and I was looking into the death of the number of sailors or sea or fisherman (sic) or whatever you want to call them, that were on board a boat that was sent out in a boat (sic) that was known by a marine engineer to be a hand grenade, whether I would be recommending to the Attorney General that that marine engineer be charged with manslaughter. That’s what I was thinking. I am extremely distressed to hear that your client, Mr Ludbrook, is prepared to let people go to sea in a boat and an engine that he described as a hand grenade, that’s just beyond my belief that someone should hold himself out as a professional person and to give that evidence and not only did he say it once but he said it a number of times. I’m not satisfied that he is entitled to succeed in his claims. He was engaged as a professional to carry out work with a duty of care and failed to carry out that work with anything close to the required standard of duty of care, so the claim will be dismissed. Now I also have problems with your counterclaim Mr Foster. How far do you want me to proceed with the counterclaim? <br />Mr Foster: Well, Your Honour - - - <br />His Honour: Can I indicate on the face of it, I don’t see that your client’s entitled to anything either in his counterclaim. He’s had the work done months later, he’s given evidence, as again, I didn’t find him to be credible in relation to the evidence he gave in relation to the repairs and how it occurred, but how can you show me he was any worse off as a result of this work and required – the same work had to be done regardless. I don’t believe that your client should succeed in the counterclaim either and I have nothing before me that should make me change my mind. Now I will give you a brief opportunity of explaining to me on what basis the counterclaim is laid, or you can withdraw it at this point? <br />Mr Foster: Your Honour, the basis of the counterclaim is in relation to various invoices that have been paid and which ... <br />His Honour: They may well have been paid but they would have been paid anyway. If your client had not taken the – had the motor repaired by Mr Webb he would have been up for the same expenses having it done elsewhere that he’s finally been up for. <br />Mr Foster: Right, what the difference is, if I can put it this way, those parts at the very least which had to be put into that - $6,000.00 worth of parts to be put into that engine that was otherwise then destroyed and then got a new engine for $17,000.00 - - - <br />His Honour: Your client didn’t want to spend the money to have the old engine rebuilt Mr Foster. <br />Mr Foster: Your Honour, I can’t take that matter any further, that’s a question of fact, but I do say it’s as far as damage are concerned - - - <br />His Honour: I find that as a fact that he was anxious to get back on the water as quickly as possible with as little expense as possible. Not satisfied in relation to the counterclaim. <br />Mr Foster: Your Honour, I can’t take that matter any further."<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate then stated that he would not make any order as to costs, because neither party had succeeded in its claim and the defence of each of the claim and the counterclaim would probably have resulted in the same amount of costs being incurred. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Although the learned Magistrate’s reasons are hard to follow, it is common ground that they should be construed as containing findings that:<br />(a) the parties had agreed that Mr Webb should "patch up" the boat engine, so that Mr Roumeliotis could return to the sea as quickly as possible, with the least expense to him; <br />(b) Mr Roumeliotis did not want to incur the expense of having the boat engine rebuilt by Mr Webb;<br />(c) Mr Webb carried out repairs to the engine; <br />(d) the repaired engine subsequently failed and was replaced;<br />(e) Mr Webb breached his duty to take reasonable care in carrying out the repair work, thereby causing loss and damage to Mr Roumeliotis; and <br />(f) the loss and damage to Mr Roumeliotis caused by Mr Webb’s breach amounted to losses equal to the amount of the debt, namely $5,315.19[2].<br /><strong>The grounds of appeal <br />11.</strong>&nbsp;The appeal was brought under s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 and Order 58.06 of the Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules 1996. Mr Roumeliotis only appealed in relation to the order dismissing the counterclaim. The questions of law stated in the notice of appeal, filed on 29 July 2005, were:<br />"1. Did the learned Magistrate err by finding that as a result of the damage to the engine, the same repairs or works were required on the engine as the Appellant had originally sought from the Respondent? <br />2. Did the learned Magistrate err by finding that the amount to be paid by the Appellant to the Respondent to have the boat engine repaired was equivalent to the expense that the Appellant would have incurred in having the boat engine repaired elsewhere? <br />3. Did the learned Magistrate err by omitting to refer to or consider the expert evidence of Mr David Padfield including the expert report prepared by Mr Padfield dated 13 April 2005? <br />4. Did the learned Magistrate err by finding that the counterclaim must be dismissed because the Appellant did not desire to have the boat engine rebuilt? <br />5. Did the learned Magistrate err by finding that the counterclaim must be dismissed because the Appellant desired to have the boat engine repaired as quickly as possible with as little expense as possible? <br />6. Did the learned Magistrate err by finding that the Appellant had suffered no loss and damage?"<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Essentially, the questions of law were amended to ask whether:<br />(a) a reasonable Magistrate could rely on Mr Webb’s evidence to find that a full engine rebuild was required as at the date the engine was delivered to him for repair; <br />(b) if the Magistrate did reasonably come to that conclusion, his Honour erred in law because there was no evidence upon which he could reasonably conclude that the cost of rebuilding the engine at that time would have equalled the cost of its subsequent replacement; and <br />(c) a reasonable Magistrate could have come to the decision on the evidence that precisely $5315.19 was spent as a result of Mr Webb’s negligence, to exactly offset the amount of the claim.<br />The appeal proceeded on the basis of the reformulated questions. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Webb submitted that, in effect, his Honour had, impliedly, found that the amount of loss and damage sustained by Mr Roumeliotis totalled the amount of his claim and had been set off against it. He argued that the evidence was not conclusive that there had been any amount expended by Mr Roumeliotis greater than the amount of the claim. He relied upon the imprecision in the evidence in relation to the amount spent on parts for the repair and the estimate of cost. He noted Mr Roumeliotis’s evidence that he had spent "close to $6,000" for the parts used by Mr Webb in the repairs. He referred to an invoice reflecting expenditure of $3,789.76 and noted that there was no evidence about the alleged loss of income or repairs. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In any event, counsel for Mr Webb submitted, his Honour might be taken to have found that Mr Roumeliotis was guilty of contributory negligence in not having the engine rebuilt, when it was necessary. His decision was submitted to be consistent with a finding that Mr Roumeliotis was one hundred percent responsible for the loss of $15,625, being the cost of the replacement engine. He referred to the evidence of Mr Webb’s estimate of the cost of replacement at the outset. He argued that the evidence justified a finding that Mr Roumeliotis was, ultimately, no worse off. <br /><strong>Conclusion <br />15.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate’s reasons do not explain the process by which he arrived at his conclusions. The extent to which he accepted or rejected the evidence is unclear. It would seem that his Honour must have found that Mr Roumeliotis was entitled to precisely the sum of $5,315.19 by way of damages under the counterclaim, in order to justify the dismissal of the claim on the basis of a set off.<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;If Mr Roumeliotis succeeded in relation to the counterclaim, there was, in my opinion, no evidence upon which the Magistrate could have reasonably concluded that the amount of damages to which he was entitled was exactly the amount of the claim or the debt alone. Quite apart from the fact that the hearing had proceeded on the basis that liability only was to be determined, such a finding was not open on such evidence as there was before the Magistrate, in my view[3]. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;I am not persuaded by Mr Webb’s argument to the effect that his Honour’s decision to dismiss the counterclaim is explicable on the basis of an implied finding of contributory negligence on the part of Mr Roumeliotis. Even if the cost of the replacement engine were to be ignored, the evidence as to the cost of the parts purchased by Mr Roumeliotis to carry out the wasted repairs would appear to have supported either a small order in relation to the claim (which is not the subject of the appeal) or a small order in relation to the counterclaim.<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;I would allow would answer the reformulated questions of law as follows: <br />(a) yes; <br />(b) yes; and <br />(c) no. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;The appeal should be allowed. I will hear the parties as to the form of orders and costs. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] T 63. <br />[2] Rule 13.14 of the <em>Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules </em>1996 allows the setting off of the appellant’s claim for damages against the respondent’s claim for debt. <br />[3] See: <em>Spurling v Development Underwriting (Vic) Pty Ltd </em>[1973] VR 1 at 11 per Stephen, J.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the appellant Roumeliotis: Mr J Foster, counsel.

It is, generally speaking at all events, open to the court to exercise a wide discretion in the interests of justice in considering whether an applicant who has failed on the merits may none the less succeed on a second application. It follows that a court is not bound to conclude that the second reinstatement application will be an abuse of process unless there is "new evidence" in the sense in which that expression is used in connection with the admission of evidence on appeals. The extent to which the second reinstatement application is based upon evidence which was available to be produced on the hearing of the first reinstatement application, but was not so produced, will be a relevant factor in determining the second reinstatement application. Further, new circumstances that the stay amount has been paid and a proposed further amended statement of claim has been formulated are relevant factors to be taken into account on the hearing of the second reinstatement application. In this regard also, the reasons why these circumstances did not exist at the time of the hearing of the first reinstatement application will be a relevant consideration.<br />&nbsp;<em>Nominal Defendant v Manning </em>(2000) 50 NSWLR 139, followed.<br />&nbsp;<em>National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson </em>(2002) 55 NSWLR 315, followed.<br />&nbsp;<em>DA Christie Pty Ltd v Baker </em>[1996] 2 VR 582, considered.<br />&nbsp;<em>Guss v Magistrates Court of Victoria </em>[1998] 2 VR 113; MC22/97, not followed.<br />&nbsp;<em>Stragan &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Christodoulou </em>MC19/02, not followed.<br /><br />HARGRAVE J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;By notice of appeal dated 6 April 2006 the plaintiff appealed to a judge against the decision of the Senior Master made on 30 March 2006 to dismiss its application that this proceeding be reinstated. The appeal was heard by me in the Practice Court. The appeal raised an important issue of practice and procedure. Accordingly, I reserved my decision.<br /><strong>FACTS <br />2.</strong>&nbsp;The proceeding was commenced on 14 January 2000. The plaintiff makes allegations concerning the conduct of the defendant in and between 1990 and 1994. There have been a number of versions of the statement of claim. Some of the issues which were initially raised have been the subject of summary judgment against the plaintiff, and other allegations have been struck out. There is no doubt that there has been inordinate delay by the plaintiff in the prosecution of the proceeding. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;On 27 February 2002, Master Kings ordered pursuant to Rule 63.03(3)(a)[1] that the proceeding be stayed until such time as the plaintiff paid the sum of $25,723.40 ("the stay amount") to the defendant. This amount was due in respect of unsatisfied costs orders made by the Court on previous applications. Further, Master Kings ordered that certain paragraphs of the then current statement of claim be struck out and that the plaintiff have leave to file and serve an amended statement of claim within 14 days of payment of the stay amount.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff did not pay the stay amount. Accordingly, the proceeding remained stayed for over a year. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Following correspondence from the Prothonotary’s office to the solicitors for the plaintiff in 2003, Bongiorno J ordered on 22 August 2003, on the Court’s own motion, that the proceeding be dismissed "with a right of reinstatement". <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;In about April 2004, Mr Leslie Thomas, who is the sole director and shareholder of the plaintiff, met and persuaded a solicitor to act for the plaintiff. Soon after, on 14 May 2004, Thomas (with the assistance of his daughter) borrowed the stay sum and procured the drawing of a bank cheque for that amount in favour of the defendant’s solicitors, Mallesons Stephen Jaques. For reasons which are not explained in the evidence, this bank cheque was never tendered to the defendant or its solicitors and became stale.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;By summons dated 22 August 2005, the plaintiff made its first application to have the proceeding reinstated ("the first reinstatement application"). The first reinstatement application was heard and determined by Master Efthim on 3 October 2005.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff relied upon two affidavits sworn by Thomas. These affidavits deal with the underlying events about which the plaintiff complains in the proceeding, and with the procedural history of the proceeding. Further, Thomas deposes to his own limited financial means and the fact that he required the assistance of his daughter to borrow money enabling him to procure the bank cheque for the stay amount in May 2004. As I have said, there is no explanation as to why the bank cheque was not tendered to the defendant or its solicitors. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Master Efthim also considered a detailed written outline of argument on behalf of the defendant dated 30 September 2005. This written outline discloses that the first reinstatement application was opposed on a variety of grounds, including submissions that:<br />(1) It would be futile to reinstate the proceeding because the plaintiff appeared to be insolvent. Reliance was placed upon the fact that further costs orders had been made against the plaintiff in the proceeding, in respect of which a draft bill of costs had been prepared in the sum of $18,141.95, and to the fact that the plaintiff had provided no explanation for "holding back" delivery of the bank cheque for the stay amount. <br />(2) Because the plaintiff had not paid the stay amount, the present form of the plaintiff’s pleading was unknown. <br />(3) Given the delay in the proceeding, and the fact that all relevant limitation periods had expired, it was futile to reinstate the proceeding because an application to dismiss it for want of prosecution would almost certainly succeed. In this regard, the defendant submitted that there had been inordinate delay in the prosecution of the proceeding and that the Court could safely infer that the delay would prejudice the fair trial of the proceeding. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;After considering the two affidavits sworn by Thomas and the arguments on behalf of the defendant, Master Efthim determined to dismiss the first reinstatement application. It is apparent that he did so after a full hearing on the merits of the application. In particular, it is apparent that Master Efthim did not dismiss the application on the sole ground that the plaintiff had not paid the stay amount or delivered an amended statement of claim consequent upon doing so. Although the Master did not give written reasons for his decision, he incorporated into the "OTHER MATTERS" section of his order the following statements:<br />"1. Application is dismissed.<br />2. Material filed on behalf of the Plaintiff is deficient: <br />- No amended Statement of Claim before the Court<br />- No explanation for delay - inferences at best can be made in Affidavit<br />- No explanation given by the Plaintiff why cheque drawn in May 2004 was not delivered to the payee and no explanation why application not brought prior to September 2005<br />- No explanation how other costs outstanding to be paid<br />- Likely to be some prejudice to [Defendant][2]<br />- Facts go back to 1990 (likely to have [been] change of personnel)<br />- Order 34.05 – used as a guide only."[3]<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that I should find that Master Efthim dismissed the first reinstatement application on the sole ground that the plaintiff had not paid the stay amount, thus lifting the stay ordered by Master Kings and permitting the filing of an amended statement of claim. I reject this submission. Master Efthim clearly considered the arguments put on behalf of the defendant and, in his brief "reasons" referred to a number of factors other than the plaintiff having failed to pay the stay amount and file an amended statement of claim. I find that Master Efthim heard and determined the first reinstatement application on its merits.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;By notice of appeal dated 7 October 2005, the plaintiff appealed against the order of Master Efthim dismissing the first reinstatement application. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The appeal was first considered on 28 October 2005. On that day, Williams J ordered that the further hearing of the appeal be adjourned to 11 November 2005 on condition that the plaintiff pay the stay amount to the Senior Master or the Prothonotary, such amount to be paid to the defendant on the determination of the appeal. The plaintiff did not pay the stay amount. Instead, it abandoned the appeal from the order of Master Efthim and that appeal was dismissed with costs. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;By summons filed 23 December 2005, the plaintiff made a second application to a master for an order that the proceeding be reinstated ("the second reinstatement application"). In addition, the summons sought leave to amend the statement of claim in the form of a draft amended statement of claim exhibited to an affidavit filed with the summons. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;In a further affidavit sworn by Thomas, he stated:<br />"On behalf of the Plaintiff, I hereby irrevocably undertake that in the event that this Court exercises its discretion to reinstate the proceeding in accordance with the Plaintiff’s current Summons, the Plaintiff shall pay the sum of $25,723.40 as a condition of any such re-instatement within 7 days of the making of an order for conditional re-instatement. I had previously procured a Bank cheque in this sum with the support of my daughter as evidence of my ability to raise the necessary funds to discharge the cost orders in the even(t) that the proceeding was reinstated. These funds remain available to discharge the taxed costs ordered in favor of the Defendant."<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The second reinstatement application was heard by the Senior Master on 8 and 30 March 2006.<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;On 8 March 2006, the Senior Master adjourned the second reinstatement application to enable two things to happen. First, the Senior Master ordered that unless the plaintiff tendered to the defendant a bank cheque for the stay sum by 4.00 pm on that day, the application would stand dismissed.[4] Secondly, the Senior Master directed the parties to exchange written outlines of argument on the following question:<br />"... concerning whether on a second application, in effect to set aside a judgment, the applicant is confined to new evidence (taken in conjunction with the old) which was not available to the applicant at the time of the hearing of the first application."<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;Following the payment of the stay sum and the exchange of the written outlines of argument ordered by the Senior Master, the Senior Master heard and determined the second reinstatement application on 30 March 2006. The Senior Master dismissed the second reinstatement application, in the following circumstances. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;On the hearing of the second reinstatement application, counsel for the defendant made an oral application to dismiss the second reinstatement application as an abuse of process. The Senior Master heard and determined this oral application and determined to accept it. The Senior Master’s brief reasons appear in the "OTHER MATTERS" section of his authenticated order. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;In summary, the Senior Master decided that the second reinstatement application sought an order akin to that sought in an application to set aside a judgment in default of appearance or defence, or in consequence of non-compliance with an order of the Court. Based upon this characterisation of the second reinstatement application, the Senior Master held that he was bound by two single judge decisions of this Court in <em>Guss v Magistrates’ Court of Victoria</em>[5] and <em>Stragan and Co Pty Ltd v Christodolou</em>[6]. The Senior Master continued:<br />"In consequence, the Court as presently constituted may not have regard to the evidence adduced on the previous application or evidence which could have been produced on the previous application unless there is also in support of this application ‘new’ evidence or material which was not available and could not have been available to the plaintiff for the previous application."<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;The Senior Master held that the "new material" relied upon by the plaintiff, being the payment of the stay amount and the production of a proposed further amended statement of claim, did not satisfy the test of "new evidence" required by the decisions in <em>Guss </em>and <em>Stragan</em>. Accordingly, he dismissed the second reinstatement application as an abuse of process, without considering the merits of the application. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;As I have said, by notice of appeal dated 6 April 2006, the plaintiff appeals against the decision of the Senior Master. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;On the hearing of the appeal, I was asked to proceed in the same way as the Senior Master proceeded, and hear and determine the oral application by the defendant to dismiss the second reinstatement application as an abuse of process. Although the hearing of an appeal from a Master is a rehearing de novo, I accepted the submission of both parties that I should proceed in this way. Having considered the written outlines of argument filed on behalf of the parties, it seemed to me that, if the defendant’s submissions concerning the applicable law were correct, this would avoid the necessity for the Court to consider the merits of the second reinstatement application and the substantial affidavit material filed in respect of it. <br /><strong>APPLICABLE LAW <br />24.</strong>&nbsp;On behalf of the defendant, it was submitted that I was bound to find that the second reinstatement application was an abuse of process because it was not based upon "new evidence" which was not available at the time of the hearing of the first reinstatement application. Reliance was placed upon the Court of Appeal decision in <em>DA Christie Pty Ltd v Baker</em>[7] and on the application of the principles discussed in <em>Christie </em>by Batt J in <em>Guss </em>and Beach J in <em>Stragan</em>.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Christie</em>, the Court of Appeal considered an appeal from a decision of a County Court judge to allow a second application for an extension of time within which to bring an action under s23A of the <em>Limitation of Actions Act </em>1958 (Vic). An initial application for extension of time had been dismissed by a different County Court judge on the grounds that there was no explanation for the delay. The second application was supported by material explaining the delay. The appeal was allowed by majority, Brooking and Hayne JJA, (Charles JA dissenting). <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Brooking JA decided the appeal on the basis that the second application was caught by the principle of issue estoppel.[8] <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Brooking JA continued:<br />"If I were wrong in this view, I should still be of the opinion that the appeal must succeed.... If the principle of issue estoppel was inapplicable, then it was for the judge to consider whether it was an abuse of process for the respondent to apply again when he had failed on the merits and when he vouchsafed no explanation of his omission to put forward at the time of the first application the additional material on which he now relied. If the decisions I have cited do not lead to the conclusion that an issue estoppel arose here, then in my view they at least support the conclusion that on the facts of this case the respondent, having not ‘come fully prepared with proper materials in the first instance’, and having not sought any adjournment once the gap in his case became apparent, and having offered no explanation of his failure to put forward the material which was later provided, should not be allowed to vex the appellant with a second application. The judge failed to turn his mind to this question. We are in as good a position as he to determine the question and we should do so adversely to the respondent, and allow the appeal. I agree, with respect, with what Hayne JA has written on the subject of abuse of process."[9]<br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;However, Brooking JA stated clearly that he was not stating a general rule which was applicable to all interlocutory applications, and his acceptance of the reasoning of Hayne JA on abuse of process must be viewed in this light. Brooking JA stated in this regard:<br />"It is arguable ... that, questions of practice and procedure being under the control and generally within the discretion of the court in which the action is brought, it is, generally speaking at all events, open to the court to exercise a wide discretion in the interests of justice in considering whether an applicant who has failed on the merits may none the less succeed on a second application. ... We are concerned, not with the ordinary interlocutory application made in the course of litigation, which is governed by the court’s own practice and procedure, but with an application under a statute which empowers a court to enlarge a limitation period if it decides ..."[10]<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;Hayne JA decided the appeal on the ground of abuse of process. Counsel for the defendant in this proceeding placed particular reliance upon the following statement by Hayne JA:<br />"Consideration of the private interest of a respondent to an application under s23A in having certainty on the question whether action may be brought against it notwithstanding the expiration of the relevant limitation period, together with consideration of the important public interest in ensuring that judicial determinations are binding, final and conclusive and that there should not be conflicting decisions on the same issue lead me to the view that the circumstances in which second applications under s23A may be made after dismissal of an earlier application are limited. So far as presently relevant that limitation is to be imposed by an application of principles concerned with abuse of process and in at least most cases may be resolved by concluding that a second application is an abuse unless there is proof of fraud or it is sought to adduce fresh evidence, ‘fresh’, that is, in the sense in which that expression is used in connection with the admission of evidence on appeals."[11]<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;In common with Brooking JA, Hayne JA made it clear that he was not laying down any general rule to be applied to interlocutory applications of whatever kind:<br />"Whether the same considerations apply to interlocutory applications of the kind I have mentioned earlier – those under the control of and generally within the discretion of the court in which the action is brought – is not a matter I have to decide. Nothing I say here should be read as deciding whether the renewal of such an application is an abuse of process. Moreover, given the breadth of possible application of the principles of abuse of process, I do not intend in what I say to attempt some definition of the circumstances properly to be regarded as constituting an abuse of process or to say that it is only upon proof of fraud or the adducing of fresh evidence that a second application of the kind now under consideration can be said not to amount to an abuse. The hazards of attempting some general definition of such broad and discretionary principles as are encompassed in the simple expression ‘abuse of process’ are well known and need not be restated."[12<br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Guss</em>, the defendant sought judicial review of a decision of the Magistrates’ Court allowing the plaintiff’s third application to set aside a default judgment. Notwithstanding the clear statements by both Brooking and Hayne JJA in <em>Christie </em>that they were not laying down any general rule as to when an interlocutory application will constitute an abuse of process, Batt J appears to have applied <em>Christie </em>as establishing a rule of general application. Batt J stated:<br />"But in my view the second defendant was also correct in his submission that the magistrate was not bound to consider the whole of the material and in particular the material which he and Mr Myers had previously considered. In my view, that conclusion is required by the judgments of Brooking JA and Hayne JA in DA <em>Christie Pty Ltd v Baker</em>, when properly understood, even though small passages in those judgments, if taken by themselves, might be argued to point in the opposite direction. Further, on the view of Hayne JA and, I think, of Brooking JA, the magistrate was probably only bound to consider material that was not available at the time of the previous application. Their Honours relied on the principle relating to abuse of process, holding that a second application is an abuse of process unless there is proof of fraud or it is sought to adduce ‘fresh’ evidence, in the sense used in relation to admission of evidence in appeals. If the evidence was available at the time of the first application and there is no explanation of why it was not then put forward, then, at least, the second application will constitute an abuse of process. Those conditions were satisfied in the third application in the present case and, if, as I think, that part of <em>Christie v Baker </em>is applicable to s110, the magistrate was bound to dismiss the application and not to investigate it, contrary to the plaintiff’s contention before me. If anything, the magistrate’s test of ‘newness’ was too generous. Certainly he should not have gone further, as the plaintiff contended."[13] (Citations omitted.)<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Later in his judgment, Batt J stated the principle in this way:<br />"I would add that statements in other cases, such as <em>Carr, Hall v Nominal Defendant</em>, <em>Guss v Johnstone </em>and <em>Seymour v Holm</em>, show that, except where there has been a dismissal of the first application for a technicality or where there is fraud or where new evidence becomes available after the dismissal of the first application, a second application is almost certainly doomed to failure. Statements to that effect seem to me to recognise that the judicial officer hearing the second or subsequent application need not reconsider any of the material considered on earlier applications, save of course to the extent necessary for comparing the corpus of material before him or her with that before his or her predecessor in order to ascertain what is new material."[14] (Citations omitted.)<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Stragan</em>, Beach J considered an application for judicial review of a decision of a magistrate to allow a second application to set aside a default judgment. Beach J followed the decision of Batt J in <em>Guss </em>and, because there was no new evidence on the second application, set aside the order of the magistrate. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of the defendant that the second reinstatement application was indistinguishable from the second and third applications to set aside the default judgments which were considered in <em>Guss </em>and <em>Stragan</em>. As those decisions relate to a matter of practice and procedure, it was submitted that I ought to follow them unless convinced that they were clearly wrong. Reliance was placed upon <em>Bunting v Venville</em>.[15]<br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;Since the decisions in <em>Guss </em>and <em>Stragan </em>there have been further developments. In <em>Global Realty Development Corp v Dominion Wines Ltd (in liq)</em>,[16] Mandie J considered a second application for injunctive relief. Reliance was placed upon <em>Christie</em>. Mandie J rejected the submission that <em>Christie </em>established a general rule as to what constituted an abuse of process for all interlocutory applications.[17<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Nominal Defendant v Manning</em>,[18] the Court of Appeal in New South Wales, by majority, declined to follow the majority decision in <em>Christie</em>.[19] Like <em>Christie</em>, <em>Manning </em>involved a consideration of whether a second application to extend the time within which to commence proceedings was an abuse of process. Although the majority declined to follow <em>Christie </em>in respect of such applications, there was agreement that it was undesirable to lay down any general rule to be applied in considering whether an interlocutory application constitutes an abuse of process. For example, Heydon JA said:<br />"... there are considerable differences between the particular goals of each type of [interlocutory] order and the categories of circumstances in which each type of order is made. These differences make it difficult to propound a general rule suitable for all cases when the controversy in one specific case for decision does not have characteristics which are common to all categories. Not only are the categories different, but the circumstances of particular cases falling within each category are almost infinitely various. It is unlikely that a single set of rigid and exhaustive criteria could justly settle all issues."[20]<br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>National Parks and Wildlife Service v Pierson</em>[21] the Court of Appeal in New South Wales considered a second application to reinstate a proceeding which had been struck out for default in compliance with the Court’s directions. Palmer AJA, with whom Mason P and Santow JA agreed, considered that if an application for reinstatement was made before the default had been cured, and was dismissed for this reason, there was no bar to a second application after the default had been cured. This was because "there will have been a change in the circumstance which led to the refusal of the first application."[22] Further, Palmer AJA considered that it was not impossible for a second application for reinstatement to succeed, even if the default has not been cured prior to the making of the application, "because the overriding principle governing the approach of the court to interlocutory applications is that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case."[23] <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Philip Morris Ltd v Attorney General for the State of Victoria &amp; Lindsey</em>[24] the Court of Appeal considered a ninth application by a vexatious litigant for leave to commence proceedings. Maxwell P was of the view that it was not open to Philip Morris to argue that the application itself was an abuse of process.[25] However, as the matter had been fully argued, Maxwell P considered whether the application was itself an abuse of process. In doing so, Maxwell P considered <em>Christie</em>, <em>Manning </em>and <em>Pierson</em>.[26] Although Maxwell P did not state expressly that he disagreed with the majority in <em>Christie</em>, a full reading of his Honour’s judgment indicates a preference for the approach by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>Manning </em>and <em>Pierson</em>, and the dissenting judgment of Charles JA in <em>Christie</em>. However, Maxwell P confined himself to distinguishing <em>Christie </em>on the basis that it was a different kind of application and did not involve "judge shopping."[27] <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;Ormiston JA was not convinced that Philip Morris could not argue that the application was itself an abuse of process.[28] As to whether <em>Christie </em>should be applied to interlocutory applications generally, and not just applications to extend time to commence proceedings, Ormiston JA stated: <br />"Moreover I would prefer to express no opinion as to the extent to which <em>Christie v Baker </em>should be applied in relation to applications such as the present. I would say only that it must be remembered that the rules relating to <em>res judicata </em>and issue estoppel frequently are inapplicable to matters decided on interlocutory applications such that, if there be no firm rules relating to the relitigation of matters on interlocutory applications, there might well be a rush of applications from unsuccessful applicants mending their hand in the light of unfavourable interlocutory decisions."[29]<br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;Eames JA agreed with Ormiston JA that <em>Philip Morris </em>was not prevented from arguing that the application was itself an abuse of process. Whilst agreeing with the reasons of Maxwell P as to why the application in that case did not constitute an abuse of process, Eames JA stated that he did not consider Maxwell P to have cast doubt on the statements of principle made in <em>Christie</em>. With respect, as I have said, my view of the judgment of Maxwell P is that it indicates, without deciding, a clear preference for the approach of the New South Wales Court of Appeal over that expressed in <em>Christie</em>. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;My review of the authorities has led me to the conclusion that I am not bound, in considering the second reinstatement application in this case, to apply <em>Guss </em>and <em>Stragan</em>, with the effect that I am limited to considering any "new evidence" which was not available on the hearing of the first reinstatement application. I am of this view for the following reasons. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;In the first place, although the second reinstatement application is of a similar kind to an application to set aside a default judgment, it is a different application. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, the decision of Mandie J in <em>Global Realty </em>constitutes a single judge decision which is contrary to the decisions in <em>Guss </em>and <em>Stragan</em>. In these circumstances, the weight to be attached to the fact that the decisions in <em>Guss </em>and <em>Stragan </em>concern matters of practice and procedure is diminished. <br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;Thirdly, and most importantly, both Brooking and Hayne JJA in <em>Christie </em>clearly stated that they were not purporting to lay down any general rules to be applied in determining whether any interlocutory application constitutes an abuse of process. <br /><strong>45.</strong>&nbsp;Fourthly, the variety of interlocutory applications and of the circumstances pertaining to each individual application dictate, in my view, that it is undesirable that there be a set of rigid rules to be applied to every case where a second interlocutory application is made after the refusal of a first application for the same relief. In this regard, I respectfully adopt the passage from the judgment of Heydon JA in <em>Manning </em>quoted above[30] which was referred to with apparent approval by Maxwell P in <em>Philip Morris</em>.[31] <br /><strong>46.</strong>&nbsp;As a result, it is my view that the correct approach to apply to second or subsequent interlocutory applications is that stated in <em>Manning </em>and <em>Pierson </em>that "the overriding principle governing the approach of the court to interlocutory applications is that the court should do whatever the interests of justice require in the particular circumstances of the case."[32] As I have said, this statement was referred to with apparent approval by Maxwell P in <em>Philip Morris</em>.[33] Further, this approach is consistent with the statement of Brooking JA in <em>Christie </em>quoted above in respect of interlocutory applications concerning questions of practice and procedure that:<br />"... it is, generally speaking at all events, open to the court to exercise a wide discretion in the interests of justice in considering whether an applicant who has failed on the merits may none the less succeed on a second application."[34]<br /><strong>CONCLUSION <br />47.</strong>&nbsp;It follows that the application by the defendant to dismiss the second reinstatement application on the grounds that it is an abuse of process is not to be determined in accordance with the submissions made on behalf of the defendant. I am not bound to conclude that the second reinstatement application will be an abuse of process unless there is "new evidence" in the sense in which that expression is used in connection with the admission of evidence on appeals. Having said that, the extent to which the second reinstatement application is based upon evidence which was available to be produced on the hearing of the first reinstatement application, but was not so produced, will be a relevant factor in determining the second reinstatement application. Further, the new circumstances that the stay amount has been paid and a proposed further amended statement of claim has been formulated are, in my view, relevant factors to be taken into account on the hearing of the second reinstatement application. In this regard also, the reasons why these circumstances did not exist at the time of the hearing of the first reinstatement application will be a relevant consideration. <br /><strong>48.</strong>&nbsp;The issue remains as to how the second reinstatement application should be disposed of. The merits have not yet been enquired into by a master. In all the circumstances, I will not make any orders on the appeal at present. Once the parties have had an opportunity to consider these reasons, I will proceed to hear and determine the second reinstatement application, which is before me on the appeal for rehearing <em>de novo. <br /></em>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] <em>Supreme Court (General Civil Procedure) Rules </em>1998.[2] The authenticated order refers, in error, to prejudice to "Plaintiff". This is an obvious error, as the relevant question before the Master, which was the subject of submissions by the defendant, concerned prejudice to the defendant. <br />[3] The reference to Order 34.05 is a reference to a submission put on behalf of the defendant that the judgment which the plaintiff was seeking to set aside was obtained in circumstances which were comparable to a judgment obtained in accordance with the previous Rule 34.05. <br />[4] In fact, the stay amount was paid after 4.00 pm on 8 March 2006.

Subsequently they took action in the Magistrates'' Court seeking full payment pursuant to the agreement. The magistrate made an order in favour of the claimants.&nbsp; An appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed.

("Hardy"). They began as proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court at Mildura, in which the learned magistrate found in favour of Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza. Hardy appealed to the Supreme Court pursuant to s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. Those appeals came on for hearing before Hansen J, who ordered that they be dismissed on 4th March 2005. The present appeals are brought against those orders, Hardy having been granted leave to appeal pursuant to s17A(3A)(b) of the Supreme Court Act 1986.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The facts are set out, comprehensively and with clarity, in Hansen J’s reasons.[1] This judgment should be read in conjunction with them but, for convenience, I shall set out again an example of the critical provision, clause 5, in the agreements between Hardy and Janevruss and Hardy and Mr and Mrs Mazza:[2]<br />"5. PRICE AND TERMS OF PAYMENT<br />The Company shall pay to the Grower for the grapes, a fair market price. The fair market price for each variety is defined as the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area (e.g. Sunraysia or Riverland). An indicative price range for each variety is normally published in December of each year after negotiations have taken place between winemakers and growers. The Company shall advise the price and payment terms to the Grower no later than seven (7) days prior to a delivery taking place. The price and terms of payment are subject to the provisions of any statute that may apply from time to time to grapes purchased for wine in any specified region. The minimum payment terms the winery agrees to pay will be 1/3 of the purchase price within 30 days of the month of delivery and the balance in two equal payments prior to the last day in months of June and September following delivery of the grapes.<br />Special Conditions<br />Minimum prices for the following varieties are guaranteed for the vintages:<br />&nbsp;1999&nbsp;2000-2002&nbsp;2003-2006&nbsp;2007-2008<br />Shiraz&nbsp;$600/tonne&nbsp;$550/tonne&nbsp;$500/tonne&nbsp;$400/tonne<br />Merlot&nbsp;$600/tonne&nbsp;$550/tonne&nbsp;$500/tonne&nbsp;$400/tonne"<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The outline of submissions filed on behalf of the appellant advanced three contentions: first, that Hansen J misconstrued the terms of a letter dated 19th December 2001[3] by finding that, in that letter, Hardy advised the price and payment terms to Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza as required by clause 5; secondly, that his Honour misconstrued the terms of the agreements by finding that the price and payment terms advised in the letter were determinative of the "fair market price" referred to in clause 5; and, thirdly, that his Honour erred in finding that Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza had established that they had not been paid the "fair market price" for the grapes they delivered to Hardy.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Dr Pannam rightly, if I may say so, abandoned the first contention. The third contention need be considered only if the second is decided in favour of the appellant.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Two matters are of particular importance in construing clause 5. The first is that the "fair market price" is exhaustively defined in the second sentence of the clause. The first and second sentences may therefore be read, and should be construed, as if they said, "The Company shall pay ... the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area". (It may be that it is impermissible to take the words "fair market price" into account at all in construing the words "the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased for a particular area".[4]) Dr Pannam agreed that, in the light of the definition in the second sentence, it was that sentence, rather than the first, on which attention should be focused.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The second important matter relates to the timeframe and uncertainty of "the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area". Hansen J emphasised the word "likely", as pointing to a future price that could not be known, not just in 2001, but in any year when Hardy gave the advice required by the fourth sentence of clause 5. I agree with his Honour, but that conclusion would follow even without the word "likely". When Hardy advises the price and payment terms no later than seven days prior to the first delivery of the season taking place,[5] the price that will be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area in that season necessarily lies in the future and is uncertain.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Dr Pannam argued that "likely" did not relate to a future time but to an hypothesis. Attention was then directed to the nature of the hypothetical price. For example, was it the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased by Hardy from a particular area or by all purchasers? Was the fruit, in the case of merlot, the total quantity of merlot irrespective of quality or merlot of the quality being offered by the grower to Hardy? What was the hypothetical market? Those questions need not be decided, because Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza accepted the price advised by Hardy and proceeded to delivery.[6] Counsel also argued that "being purchased" imported the present tense, but I think that is to read too much into those words. The second sentence refers, colloquially or proleptically, to the majority of fruit being (in the sense of "to be") purchased from a particular area.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The third sentence of clause 5 may be put to one side, although not wholly ignored. It has an historical explanation that ceased before the agreements commenced. A similar observation may be made in relation to the fifth sentence.[7] The essential provisions of clause 5 are therefore, "The Company shall pay ... the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area. The Company shall advise the price and payment terms to the Grower no later than seven (7) days prior to a delivery taking place." The price referred to in the second of those two sentences is obviously the price referred to in the first. It is the price that Hardy is to pay. Hardy’s obligation is not to advise an estimate of the price it is to pay but the price itself.<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;To put the point another way: Hardy did not contract to pay an amount equal to the price in fact realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area (whatever the last ten words may mean), but an amount equal to the price likely to be realised. The price likely to be realised, which can only be an estimate of the price in fact realised, is the price that "[t]he Company shall pay" in accordance with the first and second sentences of clause 5. Hardy is thus obliged to pay the price it estimates.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Pannam submitted that it would be an extraordinary interpretation of clause 5 if the price estimated and advised by Hardy, prior to the delivery of the grapes and prior to the season, were conclusive of the price to be paid. It would lead to unreasonable, inconvenient and unjust consequences. In particular, it would leave Hardy largely in control of the price to be paid to the growers for a period of ten years[8]. Hardy would have to act in good faith and make a reasonable estimate of the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area, but there could be a very wide range of prices falling within those parameters.<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;I accept that the result of the words used is inconvenient. It could work to the disadvantage of a grower just as much as it has in the present case to the disadvantage of Hardy. The difficulties are that "the price likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from a particular area" is quite different from the price in fact realised and that there are no provisions in the agreements for adjustments. The parties could easily have stipulated for a provisional price to be adjusted later, but they did not do so. The provision for payment by instalments does not supply the deficiency. The inconvenience of the provisions on which the parties agreed does not authorise the Court to make a better contract for them.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;It is unnecessary to decide the precise nature of the limitations on Hardy when it advises the price and payment terms to a grower pursuant to the fourth sentence of clause 5, or even whether that sentence does enable Hardy to fix the price within the limits set by the agreement. (If that is the effect of the sentence, Hardy is clearly not at large. It must act in good faith and, at the very least, the price must be such that a reasonable person could think that it was likely to be realised for the majority of fruit being purchased from the relevant area.) Those questions should be decided in a case where a grower does not accept that the price advised by Hardy is in conformity with clause 5. In the present case Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza were content with the price advised by Hardy and proceeded to delivery. In those circumstances the price is binding.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The inconvenience should not be surprising. That is what often happens when a party, in this case Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza, decides to enforce a flexible long-term framework as if it were a short-term contract. Such a decision needs to be taken with caution and, because of the built-in contradiction between the short term and the long term, it should be reviewed at every stage of the proceedings. I express no opinion about the wisdom of Janevruss and Mr and Mrs Mazza having brought the present proceedings. That is not the issue presented for our decision, nor do we know the facts necessary to express such an opinion, but this judgment would be incomplete if I did not stand back at the end to assess the conclusion in its proper context.<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;I would dismiss the appeals.<br /><strong>EAMES JA:<br />15.</strong>&nbsp;I agree that these appeals should be dismissed, for the reasons given by Callaway JA.<br /><strong>ASHLEY JA:<br />16.</strong>&nbsp;I agree with Callaway JA, for the reasons which his Honour gives, that these appeals should be dismissed.<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;I should add this. Whilst it does not directly bear upon the issue of construction which determines the fate of these appeals, clause 5 of the Janevruss and Mazza agreements only required Hardy to advise the price and payment terms to the grower "no later than seven (7) days prior to a delivery taking place." It seems that Hardy entered into a discrete agreement with each of the many growers who supplied it in the Sunraysia. It can be assumed that each agreement contained a clause akin to clause 5. It seems that, as a practical matter, Hardy sent all the growers the price advice letter of 19 December 2001. The consequence of it doing so was to lock in prices well before deliveries began, and even longer before they ended. Absent any mechanism for adjustment, there was evident potential for prices which it set to be well off the mark if deliveries did not fit the anticipated pattern. But clause 5, relevantly cast in terms of a delivery by the particular grower, did not oblige Hardy to fix prices as it chose to do in late 2001. At least in some measure, the dire consequences of the December 2001 price advice, as described by Dr Pannam, were of Hardy’s own making.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] <em>Hardy Wine Co Ltd v Janevruss Nominees Pty Ltd </em>[2005] VSC 41.<br />[2] This example comes from the agreement with Mr and Mrs Mazza.<br />[3] An example of the letter is set out in the reasons of Hansen J at [25].<br />[4] See the <em>Owners of the Ship "Shin Kobe Maru" v Empire Shipping Co.

The original lender attempted to assign its interest to Equus Financial Services. VDR made payments pursuant to the agreement but ceased them when the time-share development collapsed. Equus issued proceedings against VDR claiming the outstanding payments under the loan contract despite the fact it was not a party to the contract. In the counterclaim, VDR alleged misleading and deceptive conduct by the promoters of the Scheme together with unconscionable conduct and sought an amount by way of damages plus a declaration that the contract was void and unenforceable. Equus claimed that the matters raised in the counterclaim were barred by the Statute of Limitations. The magistrate found that there was no failure of consideration. However, the magistrate found that having regard to Equus'' conduct, VDR was entitled to avoid the contract pursuant to the provisions of s87 of the Trade Practices Act (Act). Upon appeal by Equus—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Appeal dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Equus'' cause of action arose not under the contract to purchase the time-share interest but under the contract to finance the purchase of that interest. As no evidence was led before the Magistrate to prove payment of the principal sum by the financier to the vendor, Equus failed to prove an essential element of its case. Accordingly, it would be unjust to order that VDR "repay" loan funds that were never directly received by Equus and may never have been paid out on their behalf. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Obiter: It was open to the Magistrate to hold that representations made by the financier either directly or through an agent induced VDR to enter into the loan contract. In those circumstances VDR were entitled to a declaration that the loan contract had been rescinded. A necessary consequence was that VDR would have been obliged to pay Equus the balance of the principal amount borrowed. However, the provisions of s87 of the Act were not relevant to the counterclaim given the Magistrate''s finding that VDR suffered no loss or damage. Further, the Statute of Limitations does not apply to matters raised only by way of defence.</p>\r\n<p>HARPER J:<br />1.&nbsp;This is an appeal under s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 from a judgment of a Magistrate delivered on 9 December 2003 in the Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne. It illustrates how the difficulties of a difficult case can be compounded, and its simplicities overlooked, if the relevant law is not carefully analysed. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The proceedings were initiated by a finance company as long ago as 22 April 1994. The then plaintiff, Equus Financial Services Ltd[1] (“Equus”) is the present appellant. It claimed under a loan contract to which it was not a party. The original lender was one of a group of companies whose business it was to develop time-share resorts. In this case, the location was Yarrawonga: a delightful holiday destination, but under-rated compared with Miami and Monaco. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;The venture did not fulfill the hopes of those behind it. Liquidation has been the fate of some if not all of the companies in the group. As a result, Frederick and Sheila Van Der Ross, the present respondents and the defendants to the original proceedings, have never taken advantage of the time-share that, on 12 January 1991, they agreed to purchase from a vendor whose identity is not certain, but which was probably a corporation called Club Resorts Ltd. The financier was another corporation, admittedly linked to the vendor within the meaning of the expression “linked credit provider” as defined in s73(14) of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Its name was Club Resorts (Finance) Ltd (“CRF”). The amount financed was, as the statement of claim alleges, $10,490.00. By the terms of the relevant loan contract, this sum was to be repaid over a period of 84 months. Interest was charged at 23.4% per annum, with payments fixed at the rate of $254.88 per month. The total amount payable was therefore $21,409.92. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;If CRF ever intended to be the actual provider of financial accommodation to the respondents, it quickly resiled from that position. Even before the relevant loan contract came into existence CRF assigned, or attempted to assign, to Equus whatever interest it had in the relevant contract. It seems that some time later each of the vendor and CRF and the development at Yarrawonga collapsed, or at least escaped the reach of the respondents. It is probably the case that the vendor in fact received the purchase price of the respondents’ time-share, doubtless discounted to reflect the intervention of the financiers. What for practical purposes is certain is that the respondents will never receive that which they contracted to buy. Their time-share may or may not now exist; but, if it does, it is no longer available for them. Equus, nevertheless, claims to be entitled to that which, so many years ago, the respondents contracted to repay. It points to the irrelevance of the fact that, if it succeeds, the respondents will in one sense pay for nothing. Its case is that, in return for an assignment of its debt, it put CRF in funds. It is now entitled to recover the amount paid, with interest. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;The case is pleaded for Equus in a statement of claim that was delivered with the Complaint by which the proceeding began. In essence, it is a simple claim in debt. The Trade Practices Act is irrelevant to it. The respondents nevertheless introduced that legislation not only by their counterclaim, but also by their defence. It was a move which obscured the real issues so effectively that thereafter neither the practitioners nor the Magistrate were able to recognise them. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;The loan contract is said by paragraph 3 of the statement of claim to be “dated the 24th day of January 1991 (‘the said date’).” A copy is in evidence before me. It is signed “for and on behalf of the credit provider”, which “hereby certifies that this is a true copy of the loan contract ... given to the debtor for his own use.” Far from being dated 24 January 1991, however, the copy bears but one date; and this is the date upon which it was signed by the respondents: 12 January that year. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The statement of claim is internally inconsistent. The sum of $9,761.36 is allegedly owing under a loan contract pursuant to which the respondents were the borrowers. The “Credit Provider” is first identified as CRF. Despite this, the statement of claim then alleges that a contract, the one said to be dated 24 January 1991, was made between Equus “as Credit Provider” and Mr and Mrs Van Der Ross. By this contract “the Credit provider” [sic; the reader is left to work out whether this is Equus or CRF] “agreed to lend to the Defendant/s [sic] and the Defendant/s agreed to borrow from the Credit Provider the sum of $10,490.00 (‘the amount financed’) for a term of 84 months.”[2] </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The statement of claim goes on to allege, by paragraph 5, that “[o]n the said date [24 January 1991] and pursuant to the terms of the loan contract, the amount financed was (a) advanced by the credit provider to the defendants; and (b) received and accepted by the defendants” (my emphasis). This allegation is, by paragraph 5 of the respondents’ defence, denied. But it had to be made. It is, of course, central to Equus’ right to recover: unless the person seeking to recoup the alleged debt can prove, or unless the debtor admits, that the lender actually lent the amount said to represent the principal of that debt, the claim must fail. And the onus or burden of proof remains entirely with Equus. Mr and Mrs Van Der Ross having denied the allegation, Equus had no option but to attempt to make it good. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;This is not a point of merely technical significance. Its importance may be easily demonstrated. In the absence of an allegation in the statement of claim to the effect of that set out above, that pleading would not disclose a cause of action against the respondents. It would for that reason be the proper subject of a “strike out” application. Were such an application made, it would be no defence to argue that Equus itself had given good consideration for the assignment. That merely goes to the state of its relationship with CRF. It has nothing to do with the relationship between Equus and the respondents. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;In this context, another point should be noted. Despite the inept draftsmanship exhibited by the statement of claim, it is clear that its initial identification of CRF as the “Credit Provider” was correct, at least to the extent that, if credit was provided by anyone, that person was CRF. Equally, the later identification of Equus as such was wrong. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;In the meantime, however, it is appropriate to return to the statement of claim. Paragraph 7 of that document alleged that “the Credit Provider” had on 16 January 1991, “absolutely assigned in favour of the plaintiff all of its right title and interest in and the benefit of the loan contract to the plaintiff.”[3] This was some eight days earlier than the date given in the statement of claim as the date of that very contract. Notice of the assignment was said to have been given to the respondents on the same day. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;A notice bearing that date is in evidence. It informs the respondents that CRF has assigned to Equus “various interests under the loan contract ... dated 12 January 1991 ... and [that] you are required to continue to ... make all future payments of moneys due under the loan contract to Club Resorts ... or as Equus ... may direct”. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;In the light of the above, it is perhaps reasonable to assume that, despite the statement of claim, the case for Equus is that the original contract was made on 12 January between the respondents and CRF. Such an assumption, however, would quickly run into the difficulty that, according to the Magistrate, certain facts were not in dispute. One of these was that the “offer by the [respondents] to enter into a loan contract to borrow the full purchase price was accepted by [CRF] on 22 January 1991.”[4] At all events, it is clear that whatever rights the financier had under the contract were on 16 January assigned to Equus; but by the terms of the assignment the respondents were for the time being to continue to make payments to the original lender. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;At this point, CRF and Equus were working hand in hand. That this is so is clear from a Deed dated 31 August 1990 made between those two entities. It included the following<br />&nbsp;<br />“The assignor carries on the business of lending money with or without security for the purpose of financing the purchase of interests in various time-share resorts.<br />The assignor proposes to enter into various relevant agreements to provide finance for the acquisition by various parties of interests in time-share resorts and from time to time to offer the debts arising from such relevant agreements to the assignee.<br />Subject to the terms and conditions herein contained, the assignee has agreed to take an assignment from the assignor of such debts ...<br />2.1 Where the assignor forwarded to the assignee:<br />2.1.1 a request to purchase in the form provided in Annexure (‘the request to purchase’);<br />2.1.2 a copy of the relevant agreement signed by the customer;<br />2.1.3 a completed credit application;<br />the assignee shall make an offer to accept an assignment of the debt. The assignee’s offer shall be made by forwarding to the assignor a request to purchase with the purchase amount as set out herein and duly signed by the assignee.<br />...<br />7.1 On debts purchased by the assignee, the assignor shall use its best endeavours to procure that each customer shall make all payments when and as they fall due. Subject thereto, the assignor shall have authority to collect all payments and other monies payable in respect of any debt and where the assignor received any such monies the assignor shall receive them in trust for the assignee provided that such authority may be terminated by the assignee upon 7 days’ notice to the assignor at any time.”</p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;During the period beginning on 7 March 1991 and ending on 15 September 1993, the respondents continued, with a few exceptions, to pay the monthly instalments for which the loan contract provided. Then they stopped. Default notices under s107 of the Credit Act 1984 were served. A certificate issued pursuant to s55B of the Evidence Act 1958[5] by Mary Fugaro, an Administration Manager, discloses that a total of $8,156.16 made up of 30 instalments of $254.88 and one of $509.76 was received by or on behalf of Equus during that period.[6] </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;In the meantime, the development at Yarrawonga did not proceed with the despatch that the respondents thought was required. By September 1993 they had had enough. Hence their failure to continue making the instalment payments that, until then, had been regularly transmitted. They thought, wrongly as the Magistrate held, that there had been a total failure of consideration on the part of the original vendor. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;On a date that is not available to me, the respondents issued a defence and counterclaim. The denial contained in paragraph 5 of that pleading, to which I referred above,[7] is supplemented by their prayer for relief. In it, they seek damages “limited to $25,000” and “a declaration that the whole of the loan contract is void and unenforceable” either pursuant to s87 of the Trade Practices Act or on general law grounds. In the substantive body of the defence they also plead that that contract “is a tied loan contract for the purposes of the ... Act”. This is carried through in the counterclaim with an allegation of conduct by CRF in contravention of that Act. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;It is the case of Mr and Mrs Van Der Ross, as alleged in their defence, that they attended a meeting on 12 January 1991. It was called to promote time-share resorts. According to the respondents, a Mr Kevin Gaw was present at that meeting and acted on behalf of a number of entities, defined collectively as “the promoters”, which included CRF (but not Equus). They signed the loan contract on that day, induced to do so by the following representations made by the servants or agents of “the promoters, or one or some of them”:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) if the respondents paid the sum of $10,490 over a period of time they would have purchased a time-share unit at Club Yarrawonga;<br />(b) there were only 3 or 4 units left to be purchased (“the remaining units”);<br />(c) the developer wished to sell the remaining units at a special price as more money was required for the construction of a further stage of the development;<br />(d) the price of the unit being offered to the Respondents was a special price for that day only (the “sale price”);<br />(e) the sale price was lower than would ordinarily be the case;<br />(f) the normal or ordinary price for the unit was $20,000, alternatively substantially greater than the sale price;<br />(g) there was a strong demand for the units;<br />(h) the respondents were entitled on purchase of the unit to use their entitlements in respect of the unit at any time;<br />(i) the respondents were entitled on purchase of the unit to use their entitlements in respect of the facilities of other time-share resorts at any time;<br />(j) if the respondents did not wish to use their entitlements in respect of the unit during a particular year they could transfer those entitlements to be used at any time in the future; <br />(k) upon purchase of the unit, and in consideration of the purchase, all fees associated with membership of the time-share arrangement would be waived;<br />(l) upon purchase of the unit, and in consideration of the purchase, maintenance fees for the first 2 years would be waived;<br />(m) all of the details required for insertion in the loan contract standard form document were not available at the meeting;<br />(n) if the respondents signed the loan contract standard form document the remaining details would be inserted by Mr Gaw at a later date and those details would not impose any obligations on the respondents other than the obligations that had been discussed at the meeting.</p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;According to the respondents, each of the representations was false. Not only that, but the promoters were negligent in making them. Moreover, by virtue of s13 of the Sale of Land Act 1962, the representations were deemed to have been made with knowledge of their falsity. The conduct of the promoters was engaged in with the implied consent or agreement of Equus, which was a linked credit provider of, inter alia, CRF; and the loan contract was a tied loan contract under the Credit Act 1984 (as well as having the same status under the Trade Practices Act). The respondents say they have not used any of the facilities at Club Yarrawonga or any other related time-share facility. As such, they allege that the loan contract was not only voidable at their option, but has been and is now avoided – something which happened, at the latest, upon service of the defence. They plead that on this basis they are not liable to Equus for anything. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;His Honour dismissed both claim and counterclaim. Equus has appealed. The respondents have not. The statement of claim, and the respondents’ defence to it, therefore remain highly relevant. The counterclaim does not, except to the extent that it explains certain aspects of the judgment below. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;By paragraph 2 of his order of 3 March 2004, Master Wheeler settled the question of law to be decided upon the appeal. As settled, it took the following form:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Did the learned Magistrate err in the exercise of his discretion in respect of section 87 of the Trade Practices Act in setting aside the loan contract rather than assessing damages?”</p>\r\n<p>Despite this the Master also noted under “Other Matters” the following:</p>\r\n<p>“5. The question of law to be decided is:<br />(a) whether as a result of the learned Magistrate’s finding in regard to the misrepresentations the loan contract could be avoided or should have been the subject of an award for damages in favour of the appellant [sic] and any claim of the respondents [sic] should be set off against the respondents’ claim for damages arising from the misrepresentations?”</p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;I will return to the question of law as set out in paragraph 2 of the Master’s order. That set out under “Other Matters” can be put to one side. It does not make sense. It seems that the word “appellant’ and the word “respondent” where first appearing have been transposed; but even if that be assumed, it is difficult to understand what the order means. Given the above assumption, the question of law asks whether the appellant’s claim for a liquidated sum should be set off against the respondents’ claim for damages arising from misrepresentations about the loan contract. But a set-off is a defence; and a plaintiff’s claim for a liquidated sum cannot be a defence to a counterclaim for damages flowing from the entry into a loan contract which was induced by misrepresentations – or, for that matter, by conduct in breach of the Trade Practices Act. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;In their counterclaim, the respondents alleged misleading and deceptive conduct by the promoters, together with unconscionable conduct, alternatively conduct in contravention of s51AA, or alternatively of s51AB, of the Trade Practices Act. In the proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court they claimed damages of $25,000 and sought a declaration under s87 of the Act that the loan contract was in its entirety void and unenforceable. They also sought such a declaration generally as well as a declaration that no credit charge was payable by them in respect of the loan contract. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;Equus delivered a reply and defence to counterclaim. It there alleged, among other things, that the limitation periods in respect of the matters pleaded in the defence and counterclaim had expired before that document was issued. Whatever relevance this might have had in relation to the counterclaim, it is irrelevant to any issue arising pursuant to Equus’ own claim. The statute of limitations does not apply to matters raised only by way of defence. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;On 9 December 2003, the Magistrate delivered written reasons for judgment. Relevantly for present purposes, his Honour found there was not a failure of consideration.[8] In doing so, after quoting from the judgment of Balmford J in Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Jeffree[9], he indicated that he agreed with the submissions put by the appellant in that case, which reflected those put by Equus before him, that the consideration comprised the land and the time-share, both of which had been received in full. Accordingly, the failure to complete the building and operate it as a time-share did not amount, in his Honour’s opinion, to a failure of consideration. This was therefore no reason for dismissing Equus’ claim. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;In coming to this conclusion, the Magistrate examined the wrong contract. Equus’ cause of action arises not under the contract to purchase a time-share interest, but under the contract to finance the purchase of that interest. And, as the respondents assert[10] and the appellant does not explicitly deny,[11] no evidence was put before his Honour to prove payment of the principal sum by the financier to the vendor. Nor was any such evidence put before me either as having been tendered in the Magistrates’ Court or as being tendered for the first time on appeal. I must therefore proceed on the basis that Equus failed to prove an essential element of its case. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;It is true that the point was not taken on appeal. Nor, one must assume, was it taken at first instance. I confess that it did not occur to me until I came to prepare these reasons for judgment. I therefore invited each side to put written submissions to me about it. Each took advantage of that invitation. It is apparent on reading the submissions thus received that Equus has never attempted to prove, let alone made good, the allegation contained in paragraph 5 of its statement of claim. In the circumstances, I cannot simply assume that the “Credit Provider” actually provided the credit. And it would be unjust to order the respondents to “repay” loan funds that were never directly received by them and may never have been paid out on their behalf. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;As a consequence, the appeal must fail. For the sake of completeness, however, and out of respect for the arguments debated on appeal, I will deal, as did his Honour, with each of the representations that were pleaded. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;In addition to those representations, the Magistrate took into account a representation “as to interest rate and ultimate cost of the loan”. This representation was not pleaded; but no point about this was taken on the appeal. The Magistrate found that the representation set out in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph [18] above was not made.12 However, he was satisfied that the representations as I have reproduced them in sub-paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (l) of that paragraph were made. Of these, his Honour found the representations in sub-paragraphs (b) and (g) to be (arguably) puffery. He could not be satisfied that those in sub-paragraphs (h), (i), (j) or (k) were not “a combination of subsequent reconstruction and misunderstanding by the [respondents] at the time”; and those in sub-paragraphs (m) and (n) were also “unclear”. At best, the representation reproduced as (l) in paragraph [18] above was inaccurate, because “maintenance fees were in fact charged from the outset o[13]the agreement.” 13 </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;There remain the representations reproduced in sub-paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f), together with the unpleaded representation about interest rates. His Honour held that they were not only made, but also misled the respondents. His Honour’s analysis of these and of the last-mentioned sub-paragraphs appears in several passages at pp11-13 of his reasons. His Honour said:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Significantly the defendants also gave evidence that Mr Gaw represented to them that the interest rate to be paid on the loan, which would form the basis of the calculations of the credit charge, would ‘be less than that currently charged by the banks’. There was no evidence, other than the recollection of the [respondents], as to the prevailing rate of bank interest; their recollection was that it was in the region of 17-18 percent and the plaintiff did not take issue with this.<br />...<br />The evidence of the two [respondents] was consistent with respect to most of the representations as pleaded, including representations concerned with the interest rate and credit charge to be applied.</p>\r\n<p>The [respondents] impressed me as being truthful and, allowing for the passage of time, reliable witnesses. I accept that the representations did induce the [respondents] ... into entering into the contract with the vendor and the loan contract with [CRF].</p>\r\n<p>I should perhaps point out in passing, that the representations made to the [respondents] concerning the interest rate on the loan contract may well have been a representation made by [CRF] as much as by the vendor.<br />...<br />In my opinion representations (c), (d), (e) and (f) go beyond what might be described as mere ‘puffery’ and misled the [respondents] to believe that the value of their bargain was much greater than in fact it was.<br />... <br />In my opinion therefore the [respondents] did rely upon the misleading and deceptive representations made by the vendor in accordance with the above analysis, and in particular the representations as to interest rate and ultimate cost of the loan, such representations induced the [respondents] into entering the contract to purchase the time-share interest.” </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;Although these passages are not entirely clear, I read them as demonstrating that his Honour found (a) that the respondents were told that the interest rate they would be charged would be less than that currently available from banks; (b) that that representation was, and those designated (c) – (f) above were, misleading and deceptive; and that therefore all were misrepresentations; (c) that the respondents believed them; and (d) that they were induced by them to enter into both the contract to purchase the time-share and the loan contract. I note too the Magistrate’s reference to the possibility that the representation concerning the interest rate may well have been made by CRF. This is not inconsistent with his Honour’s finding that Mr Gaw was the individual with whom, in the main, the respondents dealt, and that he was employed by the vendor of the time-share. The evidence also points to his having been an agent of CRF for the purposes of making the representations. He was certainly the agent of that company in signing the loan contract on its behalf. More particularly, the conclusion that the representation about interest rates was made on behalf of both the vendor and the financier is consistent not only with the evidence available to me, but also with his Honour’s finding that that representation induced the respondents to enter into the loan contract. Most significantly of all, it is consistent with the Magistrate’s decision to dismiss the claim. In these circumstances I should, I think, proceed on the basis that it was open to his Honour to hold, and he did hold, that representations made by CRF either directly or through an agent induced the respondents to enter into the loan contract. </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;Before turning to the counterclaim, his Honour briefly considered, and equally swiftly dismissed, (a) an allegation that the conduct of the vendor was unconscionable in contravention of s51AA or 51AB of the Trade Practices Act and (b) an allegation of negligence. His Honour continued:<br />&nbsp;<br />“However the conduct of the vendor otherwise, is such that the [respondents] are entitled to an order under section 87 of the Trade Practices Act allowing them to avoid the contract with the vendor. As this is a tied loan contract, the consequence is that the [respondents] may also avoid the loan contract. This leaves the question of the counterclaim...[14]</p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;Two points should be made about this passage. First, his Honour relied upon s87 of the Trade Practices Act as a basis for dismissing Equus’ claim, not the respondents’ counterclaim. Secondly, the basis for reliance upon s87 could only have been the misrepresentations discussed in paragraph [30] above. These included representations about the rate of interest chargeable under the loan contract. CRF was a party to that contract. Accordingly, the question whether it was “tied” or not is irrelevant. </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;Given that there is no appeal against his decision to dismiss the counterclaim, I merely note here his Honour’s bases for that decision: first, that no “[p]articulars of ... damages were ... given, and no evidence was given as to the [respondents’] loss and damage”;[15] and, secondly, that “the [respondents’] damages claim against [Equus] is barred by the operation of” s82 of the Trade Practices Act, which at the relevant time provided that an action under it may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued. </p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;Equus relied upon the first of these findings as the basis for a submission that “the learned Magistrate erred in law when he ordered pursuant to s87 of the Trade Practices Act ... that the loan contract was void ab initio”.[16] Having found that damages had not been proved, it was not open to his Honour to call upon that section. According to the submission, an order under s87 “may only be made if the court finds that a party has suffered or is likely to suffer loss and damage.”[17] The submission cited, as authority for that proposition, I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd.[18] In the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in that case, their Honours noted that “orders may be made under s87 only upon the court finding that a party to the proceeding has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage.” </p>\r\n<p>36.&nbsp;This submission is correct, but it is in the end no answer to the proposition that the Magistrate arrived at the right destination after taking the wrong route. His Honour did hold that the respondents were entitled to avoid the loan contract. It was on that basis that Equus’ claim was dismissed. But that had everything to do with the claim, and nothing to do with the counterclaim. It ought to have had nothing to do with s87, either. </p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;As I have already remarked, Equus invoked not the Trade Practices Act but the general law. The respondents were (and are) entitled to resist Equus’ claim by every means open to them under the general law. And the general law “does not impose, as a requirement for effective rescission, that a party who has been induced to enter into a contract by a misrepresentation must have suffered loss and damage in the sense of a loss for which a pecuniary award may be made.”[19] It is sufficient that the innocent party suffered the detriment of being bound to a contract induced by a misrepresentation or misrepresentations. </p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;That is this case. It was found here that the respondents were induced to enter into the loan contract by a number of misrepresentations. It is true that Equus was not a party to the loan contract when first it was made. The interest which an assignee takes under an assignment is, however, subject to equities. That is so whether the assignment is statutory or equitable. The assignee’s interest is therefore subject to any defences which were available to the debtor as against the assignor which arise out of the contact assigned. The assignee can receive only whatever rights the assignor had at the time of the assignment, and if these rights are subject to reduction or extinction, the assignee can be in no better position than the assignor.[20] </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;Under the law of contract, the representee, as the party misled, is permitted to rescind the contact ab initio, provided that the parties can be restored, substantially, to their pre-contractual positions. In this case, the respondents rescinded the loan contract when Equus was served with their defence. All that is required for the parties to be substantially restored to their pre-contractual positions is that the respondents pay to that company the balance of the principal sum. </p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;A time-share is an interest in land for the purposes of s2 of the Sale of Land Act 1962. By s13 of that Act, if in any action commenced in respect of the sale of any land it is proved that any representation made on such sale was false, and that it induced a party to the action to enter into a contract to purchase the land, the representor shall be deemed to have knowledge of the fact that the representation was false. There are exceptions, but they are inapplicable to this appeal. Section 13 was pleaded in paragraph 21 of the respondents’ defence. It provides a further justification for the Magistrate’s decision. </p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;I now return to the question of law as framed by the Master. It did not reflect the real question for determination on appeal. It can, and in my opinion should, for that reason be put to one side. </p>\r\n<p>42.&nbsp;In the result, the respondents would, had the question of consideration not already been answered in their favour, have been entitled to a declaration that the loan contract has been rescinded. A necessary consequence, however, would have been an order that they pay to Equus the balance of the principal amount borrowed. According to my calculations, this amounted to the sum of $2,333.84 ($10,490.00 - $8,156.16). </p>\r\n<p>43.&nbsp;Given the absence of evidence that the amount allegedly borrowed had ever been paid, however, there can be no outcome other than that the appeal be dismissed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] Equus Financial Services Ltd converted to a proprietary company on 29 March 1996 and changed its name to Equus Corp Pty Ltd on 29 April 1996 (Exhibits “DIC-9” and “DIC-10“)<br />[2] Statement of claim, para. 3<br />[3] Ibid., para. 7<br />[4] Reasons for judgment of the Magistrate (undated), p.2<br />[5] Exhibit “DIC-2” to the affidavit of David Ivo Chapman sworn 23 December 2003. <br />[6] I note that the certificate was not put forward as constituting proof of indebtedness.

The words are plain and unambiguous. A commercial quantity of cannabis is either 25 kilograms or 100 plants.&nbsp;<br /><br />BUCHANAN JA:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;On 21 June 2002 police executing a search warrant at the applicant''s house found a number of cannabis plants in a shed divided into two rooms. Each room contained a complex hydroponic system consisting of lights, timers, ventilators and reticulated watering equipment. One room contained 24 almost mature plants. Another room contained 38 semi-mature plants. The electricity meter had been bypassed. The plants, excluding their roots, weighed 30.88 kilograms.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The applicant was arraigned in the County Court on a presentment containing one count of cultivating a commercial quantity of cannabis, one count of trafficking in cannabis and one count of theft of electricity. The applicant pleaded guilty to the count of theft and not guilty to the counts of trafficking and cultivation. After a trial the jury acquitted the applicant on the charge of trafficking and returned a verdict of guilty on the count of cultivation. A plea was made on behalf of the applicant. A total effective sentence of six months'' imprisonment was imposed, which was wholly suspended for a period of two years.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against his conviction on the count of cultivation. The sole issue raised by the application is whether the cannabis in the applicant''s possession amounted to a commercial quantity.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Section 72A of the <em>Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act </em>1981 ("the Act") provides in a convoluted fashion that cultivation of "a narcotic plant in a quantity of a drug of dependence, being a narcotic plant, that is not less than a commercial quantity applicable to that narcotic plant" is an offence for which the maximum penalty is 25 years'' imprisonment. Cultivation of less than a commercial quantity attracts lesser maximum penalties. Cannabis is a narcotic plant (s70 of the Act) and a drug of dependence (s4). The term "commercial quantity" is defined as the quantity of a drug of dependence specified in a column in a schedule to the Act "opposite to the name of that drug of dependence" (s70). The quantity opposite Cannabis L in the appropriate column in the schedule is "25.0 kg or 100 plants". "Cannabis" is defined as "any fresh or dried parts of a plant of the genus Cannabis L".<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Until the enactment of Act No. 48 of 1997 a commercial quantity of cannabis was defined only by reference to a weight of 100 kilograms. The amendment reduced the weight criterion and introduced the alternative criterion of a number of plants. Before the amendment, when a crop was discovered by the police, it was uprooted and weighed. In many cases there were disputes as to the parts of the plants which should be weighed. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;In the present case the number of plants was less than 100, but their weight exceeded 25 kilograms. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that a commercial quantity of cannabis the subject matter of a charge of cultivation is 100 plants. The weight of the plants is irrelevant. A commercial quantity of cannabis the subject matter of a charge of trafficking, on the other hand, was said to be 25 kilograms and the number of plants in a trafficker''s possession is irrelevant.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion the applicant''s construction of the definition of "commercial quantity" should be rejected. The words appearing in s70 and the schedule are plain and unambiguous. A commercial quantity of cannabis is either 25 kilograms or 100 plants. The applicant''s construction requires the addition of words, so that "25.0 kg or 100 plants" becomes "25.0 kg or in the event of cultivation 100 plants" or perhaps "25.0 kg in the event that the plants have been harvested or 100 plants".<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;I can see no warrant for such a strained construction, for I think it inapt to meet the mischief at which the Act is aimed. That mischief is the production of a large quantity of the drug cannabis. The legislature sought to apply the maximum penalty of 25 years'' imprisonment to a large quantity produced either by efficient agronomy or by large scale planting.<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the applicant contended that his interpretation derived support from the repeated use of the word "plant" and the use of the word "quantity" not "weight" in the expression "narcotic plant in a quantity of a drug of dependence" in s72A of the Act. The use of the word "plant" is simply explained by the context of cultivation, and the use of the word "quantity" could have no effect upon the interpretation of the expression "commercial quantity". Counsel also made much of the fact that the weight of plants increases as they grow. In my view the introduction of the criterion of the number of plants was intended to mitigate the effect of the date of apprehension of an offender by providing an alternative standard.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the cannabis in the applicant''s possession did constitute a commercial quantity within the meaning of the Act. I would refuse the application for leave to appeal.<br /><strong>VINCENT JA:</strong> 11. I agree. <br /><strong>EAMES JA:</strong> 12. I also agree. <br /><strong>BUCHANAN JA: </strong>13. The order of the Court will be that the application for leave to appeal against conviction is refused.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the Crown: Mr JD McArdle, QC, counsel.

At the hearing, the operator of the breath analysing instrument was called to give evidence. In cross-examination when asked what regulations he complied with he said: “I don’t know the exact regulations and what they say.” When asked whether he complied with the regulations in conducting the breath test, the operator said: “I can’t say.” In dismissing both charges, the magistrate said: “…the reality is if he doesn’t know what regulations he complied with, I can’t be satisfied he complied with the regulations. He doesn’t know what they are, he couldn’t say what they are. It leaves me in the position where I cannot be satisfied that the test result obtained was obtained as a result of a properly operated machine by an authorised officer and those .05 charges will be dismissed accordingly.” The matter went on appeal to the Supreme Court of Victoria (see <em>DPP v Luff </em>MC19/01) and to the Court of Appeal. In allowing the appeal, it was held that in relation to a charge under s49(1)(f) of the Act, it was no part of the prosecution case to prove that on the relevant occasion the breath analysing instrument was either in proper working order or properly operated. It was a matter for the defence to prove that the instrument was not properly operated on the relevant occasion. When the matter was referred back to the Magistrate, after hearing submissions, the Magistrate dismissed both charges stating that she was not satisfied that the elements of either offence were made out. Upon appeal—<br /><br /><strong>HELD: Appeal allowed. Dismissal of s49(1)(f) charge set aside and referred to the Magistrate to be further considered in accordance with the law.<br />Two decisions of the Court of Appeal now make clear that the onus is upon the defendant to establish the defence under s49(4) of the Act and that it was not for the prosecution to establish the instrument was properly operated. The approach put in submission to the Magistrate was fundamentally flawed in that it specifically invited her to simply state that she was not satisfied that the essential elements of the offence under s49(1)(f) were made out in that she was not satisfied that the instrument was operated correctly. The necessity to find positively that the defence was made out under s49(4) was not conceded. It was incumbent upon the Magistrate to consider whether she was positively satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the instrument was not properly operated. Unless she was so satisfied the relevant defence could not succeed. As the Magistrate did not consider properly or at all the onus upon the defence under s49(4), the matter is remitted to the Magistrate for further consideration.<br /><br />OSBORN J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;At approximately 12.30 a.m. on 5 December 1997 the respondent ("Luff") drove into a gate post in Osborne Street, South Yarra. Thereafter he was observed to be affected by alcohol. Following a preliminary breath test, a breath analysis was conducted at 3.07 a.m. at Prahran Police Station. The breath analysis produced certificates showing a blood alcohol concentration of 0.189%, being substantially in excess of the prescribed concentration.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Luff was charged with a number of offences including offences under s49(1)(b) or (f) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986 ("the Act"). These sections then provided:<br />"49. Offences involving alcohol or other drugs <br />(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he or she— <br />...<br />(b) drives a motor vehicle or is in charge of a motor vehicle while more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol is present in his or her blood; or<br />... <br />(f) within 3 hours after driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle furnishes a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument under section 55(1) and - <br />(i) the result of the analysis as recorded or shown by the breath analysing instrument indicates that more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol is present in his or her blood; and <br />(ii) the concentration of alcohol indicated by the analysis to be present in his or her blood was not due solely to the consumption of alcohol after driving or being in charge of the motor vehicle; <br />..."<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;When the matter came before the Magistrates'' Court these latter charges were dismissed, although Luff was convicted of four other offences arising out of the incident.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;On appeal to this Court, Balmford J set aside the orders of the Magistrates'' Court[1] and on further appeal the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of Balmford J.[2] <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;The matter came back to the Magistrate who had originally considered the matter for reconsideration in accordance with law on the basis of the evidence originally heard by her. She again dismissed the charges. The Director now appeals this decision on the basis of three questions of law:<br />(1) Did the learned Magistrate err when she ruled on the evidence that there was no case to answer? <br />(2) Did the learned Magistrate err when she ruled on the evidence that the informations should be dismissed? <br />(3) Did the learned Magistrate err in concluding if she did so, that<br />(a) the breath analysing instrument was not operated correctly, or <br />(b) she was not satisfied that the breath analysing instrument was not operated correctly?<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;It is agreed that the first question of law is misconceived.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Although question (2) is broadly expressed it was understood by the parties to raise two fundamental issues which were articulated in written submissions and oral argument before me. Those questions are:<br />(a) Was it open to the Magistrate on the evidence to dismiss the charges?; <br />(b) Did the Magistrate consider (properly or at all) s49(4) of the Act?<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Save insofar as the third question of law may be said to be subsumed by question of law (2) that question was not further argued. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Section 55 of the Act provides for breath analysis as follows:<br />"55. Breath analysis <br />(1) If a person undergoes a preliminary breath test when required by a member of the police force ... under section 53 to do so and— <br />(a) the test in the opinion of the member ... in whose presence it is made indicates that the person''s blood contains alcohol; <br />... <br />any member of the police force ... may require the person to furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument and for that purpose may further require the person to accompany a member of the police force ... for the purposes of section 53 to a police station or other place where the sample of breath is to be furnished and to remain there until the person has furnished the sample of breath and been given the certificate referred to in sub-section (4) or until 3 hours after the driving, being an occupant of or being in charge of the motor vehicle, whichever is sooner. <br />... <br />(4) As soon as practicable after a sample of a person''s breath is analysed by means of a breath analysing instrument the person operating the instrument must sign and deliver to the person whose breath has been analysed a certificate in the prescribed form produced by the breath analysing instrument of the concentration of alcohol indicated by the analysis to be present in his or her blood."<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Section 58 in turn contained evidentiary provisions:<br />"58. Evidentiary provisions - breath tests <br />(1) If the question whether any person was or was not at any time under the influence of intoxicating liquor or if the question as to the presence or the concentration of alcohol in the blood of any person at any time or if a result of a breath analysis is relevant— <br />... <br />(c) on a hearing for an offence against section 49(1) of this Act— <br />then, without affecting the admissibility of any evidence which might be given apart from the provisions of this section, evidence may be given of the concentration of alcohol indicated to be present in the blood of that person by a breath analysing instrument operated by a person authorised to do so by the Chief Commissioner of Police under section 55 and the concentration of alcohol so indicated is, subject to compliance with section 55(4), evidence of the concentration of alcohol present in the blood of that person at the time his or her breath is analysed by the instrument. <br />(2) A document purporting to be a certificate in the prescribed form produced by a breath analysing instrument of the concentration of alcohol indicated by the analysis to be present in the blood of a person and purporting to be signed by the person who operated the instrument is admissible in evidence in any proceedings referred to in sub-section (1) and ... is conclusive proof of— <br />(a) the facts and matters contained in it; and <br />(b) the fact that the instrument used was a breath analysing instrument within the meaning of this Act; and <br />(c) the fact that the person who operated the instrument was authorised to do so by the Chief Commissioner of Police under section 55; and <br />(d) the fact that all relevant regulations relating to the operation of the instrument were complied with; and <br />(e) the fact that the instrument was in proper working order and properly operated; and <br />(f) the fact that the certificate is identical in its terms to another certificate produced by the instrument in respect of the sample of breath and that it was signed by the person who operated the instrument and given to the accused person as soon as practicable after the sample of breath was analysed - <br />unless the accused person gives notice in writing to the informant not less than 28 days before the hearing, or any shorter period ordered by the court or agreed to by the informant, that he or she requires the person giving the certificate to be called as a witness or that he or she intends to adduce evidence in rebuttal of any such fact or matter. <br />(2A) A notice under sub-section (2) must specify any fact or matter with which issue is taken and indicate the nature of any expert evidence which the accused person intends to have adduced at the hearing. <br />... <br />(2D) A certificate referred to in sub-section (2) remains admissible in evidence even if the accused person gives a notice under that sub-section but, in that event, the certificate ceases to be conclusive proof of the facts and matters referred to in that sub-section. <br />... <br />(4) Evidence by a person authorised to operate a breath analysing instrument under section 55-- <br />(a) that an apparatus used by him or her on any occasion under that section was a breath analysing instrument within the meaning of this Part; <br />(b) that the breath analysing instrument was on that occasion in proper working order and properly operated by him or her; <br />(c) that, in relation to the breath analysing instrument, all regulations made under this Part with respect to breath analysing instruments were complied with—<br />is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof of those facts."<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;The relevant regulations were regulations 303, 304 and 314 of the <em>Road Safety (Procedures) Regulations </em>1988 which read as follows:<br />"Interval before taking of sample<br />303. It is a requirement for the proper operation of a breath analysing instrument that the authorised operator does not require a person to undertake a breath analysis until the operator is satisfied that the person has not consumed any intoxicating liquor for a period of at least fifteen minutes before the analysis.<br />Mouthpiece<br />304. It is a requirement for the proper operation of a breath analysing instrument that the authorised operator--<br />(a) provide a fresh mouthpiece for use by each person submitted to breath analysis; and <br />(b) use only a mouthpiece which has been kept in a sealed container until required for carrying out the analysis. <br />Certificate under section 55(4)<br />314. A certificate given in accordance with section 55(4) is in the prescribed form if it includes-- <br />(a) the serial number of the instrument; and <br />(b) the sample number; and <br />(c) the location of the test; and <br />(d) the name and date of birth of the person tested; and <br />(e) the surname of the operator; and<br />(f) the results of the self tests conducted before and after the analysis of the sample provided; and <br />(g) the results of zero tests conducted before and after the analysis of the sample provided; and<br />(h) the date and time the test was taken; and<br />(i) the concentration of alcohol in grams per 100 millilitres of blood indicated by the analysis to be present in the blood of the person tested."<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;By reason of s58(1)(c) of the Act each of the certificates printed out by the breath analysis instrument in the present case (upon compliance with s55(4) as occurred) constituted evidence of the concentration shown. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;In turn s48(1)(a) provided: <br />"48. Interpretative provisions<br />(1) For the purposes of this Part—<br />(a) if it is established that at any time within 3 hours after an alleged offence against paragraph (a) or (b) of section 49(1), a certain concentration of alcohol was present in the blood of the person charged with the offence it must be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that not less than that concentration of alcohol was present in the person''s blood at the time at which the offence is alleged to have been committed;"<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;By reason of s58(2) the certificate constituted conclusive proof of the matters referred to in that sub-section subject to notice of objection being given. In the present case notice was given requiring the person giving the certificate to be called as a witness. Thus the certificate, although remaining evidence of the analysis stated pursuant to s59(2D), was not conclusive evidence of such analysis.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Upon the initial hearing before the Magistrate the defence put in issue the question whether the breath analysing instrument was properly operated. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The operator was cross-examined first as to the basis on which he sought to refer to his notes and then as to the operation of the instrument:<br />"Q: You said in evidence in chief that you complied with the regulations when you operated the breath analysing instrument, correct?<br />A: Yes. <br />Q: Which regulations were you referring to? <br />A: The regulations for breath tests <br />Q: Which ones exactly? <br />A: I don''t know the exact regulations and what they say.<br />Q: If you don''t know the exact regulations and what they say how can you give evidence that you complied with them? <br />A: I can''t remember the exact ones. <br />Q: You don''t even know if you complied with them do you? <br />A: I can''t recall which ones they are and if I have complied no. <br />Q: It follows then does it not that you can''t give evidence that you did comply with regulations relevant to this test? <br />A: That needs to be assessed by the Court. <br />Q: Well in any event it follows from your evidence does it not that you do not know the regulations required to be complied with to properly operate the breath analysing instrument? <br />A: That needs to be assessed by the Court. <br />Q: Well doesn''t it follow that you need personal knowledge of the regulations and their requirements in order to assert that you complied with them? <br />A: As I said before that needs to be assessed by the Court. <br />Q: I suggest you are being evasive on this point? <br />A: No I''m not. <br />Q: Look, you can''t even tell the Court specifically what you did on this night with respect to compliance with the regulations can you? <br />A: I said I can''t. <br />Q: I suggest then that you simply read a bland type statement from the proforma with respect to complying with the regulations and hoped that you wouldn''t be cross-examined upon it to expose your lack of knowledge? <br />A: I am inexperienced. This is actually the first time I have given evidence as an operator. <br />Q: Is that your excuse for not complying with the regulations? <br />A: No. <br />Q: You didn''t comply with the regulations did you? <br />A: I can''t say."<br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate commenced her ruling by stating that this was a most unusual case in her experience. After making findings concerning the happening of the incident involving Luff''s driving on the night in question she stated:<br />"Senior Constable Charlesworth gave evidence that he had been an authorised operator from the 9th July 1997 a few months only. He agreed that he had done the relevant courses. He was cross-examined extensively. He also said ... ''I have never given evidence before as an operator''. And this is ... the crux of this case. I am perfectly satisfied that Rory Luff was driving the vehicle when it crashed into the fence. ... I am not, however, perfectly satisfied that he had a breath alcohol reading of .189. This is why I say it''s a most unusual case. Let me just read some of the evidence directly that Senior Constable Charlesworth gave. You will recall that when he gave his evidence I gave the witness permission to refer to his statement which contained the ... proforma proof part of a breath operator''s statement ... He continued with his evidence and then in cross-examination he said that he had read his notes before he gave evidence, though there was a lot of the formal matters that he was unable to recall. He agreed that the last page of his notes contained the formal proof. He disagreed that his mind went blank in evidence in chief just before he got to those important parts. He denied a number of other suggestions which we don''t have to ... bother about. He said he did say that he had had a blank and that''s why he hadn''t been able to recall the – which lead of course to me giving him leave. He couldn''t remember the numbers on the machine, though he remembered the machine. He was asked – he gave evidence that he complied with the regulations. He then gave this piece of evidence when asked. He was asked what were the exact regulations he complied with. He said ''I don''t know the exact regulations and what they say. I can''t remember the exact one. I can''t recall which ones they are and if I have complied.'' When put to him this question ''You can''t give evidence that you did comply with them?'' he said ''That needs to be assessed by the Court'' and he denied he was being evasive on that point. He wasn''t being evasive. He had been cornered and the reality is if he doesn''t know what regulations he complied with, I can''t be satisfied he complied with the regulations. He doesn''t know what they are, he couldn''t say what they are. It leaves me in the position where I cannot be satisfied that the test result obtained was obtained as a result of a properly operated machine by an authorised officer and those .05 charges will be dismissed accordingly."<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;On appeal Balmford J relevantly held:<br />(a) that the Magistrate had not recognised the onus cast on the defendant by s49(4) of the Act; <br />(b) that there was no evidence upon which the Magistrate could find on the balance of probabilities that the instrument was not properly operated so as to establish under s49(4) a defence to the charge under s49(1)(f); <br />(c) it was not an element of either the offence under s49(1)(b) or (1)(f) that the instrument be properly operated; <br />(d) the Magistrate had erred with respect to the basis of her decision and the matter should be remitted for further hearing in accordance with law.<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;On further appeal the Court of Appeal relevantly held:<br />(a) it was not an element of the offence either under s49(1)(b) or (f) to prove that the instrument was properly operated; <br />(b) that the decision in <em>Furze v Nixon</em>[3] was correct and that s49(4) reverses the onus of proof as to proper operation of the instrument in respect of an offence under s49(1)(f). <br />(c) the appeal should be dismissed and the matter remitted for further hearing in accordance with the order of Balmford J.<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;In so holding, however, Vincent JA (with whom Callaway and Eames JJ A agreed) recognised two matters fundamental to the issues which arise before me. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;First, his Honour noted that although the proof of proper analysis is not an element of the offence under s49(1)(b):<br />"If, however, a reasonable doubt can be seen to exist concerning the reliability of the analysis, a magistrate may well not be satisfied that the commission of the offence has been established. That is not because there is an onus cast upon the prosecution to establish that the instrument has been properly operated but because they have failed to prove the presence of an essential element of the offence itself."[4]<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, it was not the impossibility of hypothesising an analysis of the evidence favourable to Luff which vitiated the Magistrate''s initial decision but the stated basis of that decision.<br />"[31] Counsel for the appellant conceded that it was not necessary for the prosecution in order to secure a conviction under s49(1)(b) to establish that the breath analysing instrument was properly operated, and contended that the magistrate’s remarks, considered in context, should be interpreted as indicating no more than that, on the basis of the evidence taken as a whole, she was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt on this charge. She was not compelled by s58(4) to act on the basis of evidence that she regarded as hopelessly unsatisfactory, but if some "contrary" evidence was required to challenge the evidence of the operator, it was to be found in his own answers in cross-examination and re-examination, the argument proceeded. It was, counsel submitted, a relatively straightforward case in which the magistrate was singularly unimpressed by the evidence of the operator and, in consequence, was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of either an offence against s49(1)(b) or s49(1)(f) had been established. <br />[32] This argument may well have been sustainable, in my opinion, were it not for the clear identification by the magistrate of the foundation for her decision. It is not necessary, in the circumstances, to determine whether it was open to her to arrive at the conclusions she did or to explore by reference to the authorities the manner or extent to which averments of the kind encompassed by s58(4) must be depreciated before they cease to have effect as proof of the facts averred. Whilst, as Ormiston J held in <em>Binting v Wilson</em>[5], an averment made under this provision retains validity unless and until evidence to the contrary is presented to the court, the making of empty or clearly unreliable assertions of the matters set out in s58(4) would be likely to require little rebuttal in my view. However it is, I consider, evident that the magistrate simply did not reason about the matter in this fashion, which was ingeniously ascribed to her by counsel. There is little room for doubt that she regarded proof that the breath analysing instrument was properly operated as being essential before a finding of guilt could be made on either charge. In this context, I observe that when delivering reasons for dismissing the charges, and after remarking upon the various deficiencies in the evidence of the operator, she said: <br />''It leaves me in the position where I cannot be satisfied that the test result was obtained as a result of a properly operated machine by an authorized officer.'' <br />The judge in the Trial Division correctly found that in determining the matter on this basis, her Worship fell into error."<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Callaway JA, whilst agreeing with Vincent JA, added the following observations:<br />"[4] On remitter it will be for the Magistrates'' Court to decide whether the charge under s49(1)(b) of the Road Safety Act 1986 is proved beyond reasonable doubt, applying that provision in the manner explained by Vincent JA at [27][6] below, and, in relation to the charge under s49(1)(f), whether the affirmative defence afforded by s49(4) is made out. In view of some of the affidavit material, the judgment of Hedigan J in <em>Verbaken v Dowie</em>[7] and the course of argument, I am unwilling to say that there was no evidence upon which the magistrate could find, on the balance of probabilities, that the instrument was not properly operated."<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately when the matter was further considered by the Magistrate she was persuaded to adopt an approach other than that suggested by Callaway JA. When the matter came back before the Magistrate counsel for Luff submitted detailed written submissions and a folder of background material to her. On the other hand, the prosecution made an abbreviated submission to the effect that the Magistrate should find the charges proved.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;Ultimately her Honour ruled in the following terms:<br />"I don''t propose to say very much at all this morning, this matter has had a long life in the courts I suppose. It is now more than five years since this matter was before me and since that time it has had two trips to the Supreme Court. I have of course thoroughly read and I hope absorbed the Court of Appeal decision of their Honours Callaway, Vincent and Eames and it is not necessary for me to revisit the evidence that I found, that is clearly detailed in the various affidavits that have been filed. <br />This is not a rehearing and I have been assisted by submissions that have been made and all I really wish to say about proceedings now is that in relation to both of the instant charges I was not satisfied that the elements of either offence were made out in relation to them. <br />Now I don''t think it is necessary for me to articulate any more is it? I don''t think so, and those charges of course will be dismissed."<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;I turn then to the grounds of appeal. Insofar as the contention that it was not open to dismiss the charge under s49(1)(b) is concerned, in my view this must fail. The only evidence that Luff drove a motor vehicle while more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol was present in his blood or breath, was the analysis evidence constituted by the certificate. It is clear the Magistrate was not satisfied the evidence of analysis was reliable. It was open to her to conclude there was no satisfactory evidence meeting the requirements of s58(4) and that the charge was not proven because there was no direct evidence of the relevant blood alcohol concentration. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Insofar as the charge under s49(1)(f) is concerned, however, I am satisfied the Magistrate''s reasons demonstrate an acceptance of submissions made on behalf of Luff which were misconceived and as a result she did not address the onus imposed by s49(4). <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;The submissions made to the Magistrate with respect to both charges were in part as follows:<br />"(vi) The right to dismiss both charges because you are not satisfied on all the evidence that the essential elements of either offence was made out, is a right recognised by the Court of Appeal in <em>Barrett v Wearne </em>(1994) 18 MVR 331 at 334-335. It was also recognised in Luff per Vincent JA at paragraphs [31] and [32] ... in which his Honour conceded such a right, but felt bound by the ''clear identification by the magistrate of the foundation for her decision''. That is, relying on the words used in your ruling. <br />(vii) Given your findings of fact regarding the evidence of the operator, it is now open to your Honour to dismiss both charges on the basis that you are not satisfied on all the evidence that the essential elements of either offence are made out. In making that ruling, all your Honour needs to do is state it, and say nothing more."<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;It was further submitted with respect to the charge under s49(1)(f) specifically:<br />"(iv) In the instant case, there can be no stronger reason for dismissal of the charge than a finding that there can be no satisfaction that the regulations were complied with at all. On that basis, the defence under s49(4) is made out.<br />(v) In <em>Verbaken </em>... Hedigan J concluded at 468: <br />''At the end of the day, the Magistrate had to be satisfied that the breath analysing instrument was operated correctly. He clearly stated that he was not so satisfied, and that was because the evidence of the operator was inconsistent with him waiting for 90 seconds.'' <br />This finding although remarkably consistent with your Honour''s original ruling, is correct at law because it does not state that it relies upon proof by the prosecution that the breath analysing instrument was properly operated. However, if an appellate point had been taken on the plain meaning of those words, the consequences may very well have been the same as that which occurred in this case. <br />(vi) Again, in my respectful submission, the words used by your Honour in your original ruling were given a different meaning by the appellate courts from that which your Honour clearly intended. It is open now for your Honour to clearly state in reaffirming dismissal of both charges, that you were simply not satisfied that the instrument was operated correctly, on all the evidence, and also in the sense that the defence under s49(4) had been made out, if it be necessary to so find."<br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;Two decisions of the Court of Appeal now make clear that the onus was upon Luff to establish the defence under s49(4) and that it was not for the prosecution to establish the instrument was properly operated. In my view, the approach put in submission to the Magistrate was fundamentally flawed in that it specifically invited her to simply state that she was not satisfied that the essential elements of the offence under s49(1)(f) were made out in that she was not satisfied that the instrument was operated correctly. The necessity to find positively that the defence was made out under s49(4) was not conceded. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;It was incumbent upon the Magistrate to consider whether she was positively satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the instrument was not properly operated. Unless she was so satisfied the relevant defence could not succeed. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Verbaken </em>Hedigan J was ultimately of the view that the Magistrate''s reasons disclosed:<br />"...a finding that the Magistrate was satisfied that [the operator] had not waited that [specified] period and that, if he had addressed the matter specifically, he would have pronounced the view that the respondent had satisfied him, at least on the balance of probabilities that the machine had not been correctly operated."[8]<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;In the present case there is no such finding implicit in the Magistrate''s reasons, which have taken an abbreviated form at the invitation of Luff''s counsel. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;The proper test to be applied in appeals on questions of law from Magistrates’ Courts is that stated by Sholl J in <em>Yendall v Smith Mitchell &amp; Co Ltd</em>[9]; adopted by Adam J in <em>McConkey v McConkey</em>[10]. The test was restated by Sholl J in <em>Harrison v Mansfield</em>[11] after referring back to <em>Yendall v Smith Mitchell &amp; Co Ltd</em>:<br />"The true principle ... must be, not that everything relevant which a magistrate does not refer to is to be taken to have been overlooked, or on the other hand, that it is to be taken to have been considered, but that, if something which should have been considered is not referred to, and the nature of the decision suggests some error, which may have been due to that matter not having been considered as it should have been, or if the magistrate’s observations indicate, on a comparison of what he said with what he did not say, that the matter in question has not been considered as it should have been, the appellate tribunal may properly draw such an inference, and the magistrate will have no cause to complain if it does so."[12]<br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;In the circumstances of the case I am satisfied that the Director has established the Magistrate did not consider properly or at all the onus upon the defence under s49(4).<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;It remains to consider whether it was open to the Magistrate to conclude that the onus under s49(4) could have been satisfied on the evidence before her. <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;It is apparent that neither Vincent JA (implicitly) nor Callaway JA (explicitly) were prepared to exclude this possibility when the matter was considered in the Full Court. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;In my view it cannot be demonstrated that the whole of the evidence given by the operator (including the manner in which such evidence was given) could not found an inference on the balance of probabilities that the instrument was not properly operated. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;It is for the Magistrates'' Court to consider whether it is satisfied of such inference or not. <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;Accordingly the matter will have to be remitted for further consideration with respect to the s49(1)(f) charge.<br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of the Director that if the matter were remitted to the Magistrates'' Court it should not be sent back to the original Magistrate. I reject this submission:<br />(a) I do not accept that the Magistrate''s second decision gives rise to an apprehension of possible bias. The provisions she was required to construe are labyrinthine and difficult. She accepted detailed written submissions made to her in circumstances where no argument of the type put to me now by Mr Tinney was then put to her by the Director. I do not accept a reasonable onlooker would suspect she would do other than further address the case in accordance with law if it were re-submitted to her. <br />(b) It is now some eight years since the events in issue and there is a real risk that a full retrial of the matter would not result in a fair hearing. Fairness to Luff requires that the evidence originally given forms the basis of the determination of this matter. Only the original Magistrate is in a position to make such a determination properly. <br />(c) Justice demands finality in this matter be achieved as quickly as is reasonably practicable.<br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;Accordingly I propose to set aside the order of the Magistrates'' Court with respect to the charge under s49(1)(f) and direct that the matter be further considered by the Magistrate in accordance with law.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] <em>DPP v Luff </em>34 MVR 78. <br />[2] <em>Luff v DPP </em>39 MVR 277. <br />[3] (2000) 2 VR 503. <br />[4] 39 MVR 277 at [27]. <br />[5] Supreme Court, Unreported, 19 December 1989. <br />[6] Quoted at [21] above. <br />[7] (1992) 16 MVR 461 esp. at 467-468. <br />[8] 16 MVR 461 at 468. <br />[9] [1953] VLR 369 at 379. <br />[10] [1960] VR 295 at 300. <br />[11] [1953] VLR 399. <br />[12] At 404.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES: </strong>For the appellant DPP: Mr A Tinney, counsel.

An application was made to the judge that a suppression order should be made prohibiting publication of a report of the proceedings in order not to cause undue distress or embarrassment to the victims. In making the order, the judge expressed apprehension that undue distress or embarassment might later be suffered to the children. Upon application for judicial review—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Application granted. Suppression order quashed. </p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;What the Court is concerned with on an application for the making of a suppression order is whether the order is necessary to avoid an apprehended harm. The word "necessary" imposes a high standard. Parliament has accepted that there is an overriding public policy that justice be dispensed in public. This policy serves interests which are wider than those of the parties to the litigation, victims of the crime or witnesses. Paragraph&nbsp;(e) of S80AA of the County Court Act 1958, which carves out an exception to this policy, speaks only of distress to the “complainant” in specified sexual cases and, further, that the harm to be avoided is that of a distress or embarrassment to them which is undue. What is then required before a suppression order may be made in such a case is such a high degree of satisfaction in the Court that the harm will occur that the making of the order is necessary to avoid it and further, when it is appropriate to make such an order, the order must be couched in terms which are no wider than are necessary to avoid that harm.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;In the present case, the judge appears to have concluded that there was a probability that the children might suffer harm in the future. This was not a sufficient basis as a matter of law to support the opinion which s80AA required the court to have formed. <br />&nbsp;<br />BYRNE J:<br />1.&nbsp;This is an application for judicial review of an order of the County Court made on 28&nbsp;January 2005 pursuant to s80 of the County Court Act 1958 that “the publication of a report of the whole of this proceeding or of any information derived from the proceeding be prohibited”. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The proceeding in question was the trial of a woman for three sexual offences against two very young children who were in her care, and for a number of counts of theft. I have been told that she has pleaded guilty to the assault charges but that she intends to seek to change her plea. <br />3.&nbsp;The firstnamed defendant, the County Court, as is customary, has not appeared otherwise than to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court. The secondnamed defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions, appeared to oppose the application and in this regard he was supported by counsel for the accused. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The suppression order which, on its face, was made in the exercise of jurisdiction under s&nbsp;80(1)(c) was said to be warranted by s80AA(e). The plaintiff contends that the decision to make the order is vitiated by jurisdictional error and, further, for error of law on the face of the record. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;The relevant statutory provisions are as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“80. Power to close proceedings to the public <br />(1) The court may in the circumstances mentioned in section 80AA— <br />... <br />(c) make an order prohibiting the publication of a report of the whole or any part of a proceeding or of any information derived from a proceeding. </p>\r\n<p>80AA. Circumstances in which order may be made under section 80 <br />The court may make an order under section 80 if in its opinion it is necessary to do so in order not to— <br />... <br />(e) cause undue distress or embarrassment to the complainant in a proceeding that relates to a charge for an offence under Subdivision (8A), (8B), (8C), (8D) or (8E) of the Division 1 of Part I of the Crimes Act 1958 or under any corresponding previous enactment or for an attempt to commit any such offence or an assault with intent to commit any such offence; or”</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;A suppression order in similar terms had been made by the committing Magistrate on 13 May 2003. When the case was listed for mention in the County Court on 27&nbsp;October 2003 a like order was made on the application of the prosecution. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;In October 2004, application was made on behalf of the plaintiff for removal of the suppression order, but this was refused on 7 October 2004. Reasons were published on 22 October. On 13 December 2004, Whelan&nbsp;J quashed the orders of 27 October 2003 and 7 October 2004 and remitted the matter to the judge[1]. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;On the following day, 14 December 2004, a further application for a suppression order was made by the prosecutor and on 28 January 2005 the judge acceded to the application and made the suppression order which is the subject of this application and he published his Reasons. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The argument before me was directed to the requirements of s80AA(e). It was put, as to jurisdiction, that his Honour failed to address and therefore to form an opinion that the order was necessary for the avoidance of the harm referred to in paragraph&nbsp;(e); alternatively, as an error of law, that in forming such an opinion he failed to apply the correct legal principles. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;The case for the suppression order was an unusual one. The offences with which the accused woman is charged include sexual offences of the kind specified in paragraph (e). The two children, who were the victims of the alleged assaults and are therefore the complainants for the purposes of paragraph&nbsp;(e), are very young. They were said in 2003 to be respectively two and a half years and one and a half years of age. Given their age, it was not suggested that they would now suffer undue distress or embarrassment. What was put, and accepted by the judge, was that they might suffer undue distress or embarrassment in the future “at a later stage of their lives if and when they are informed that they were sexually assaulted as an infant”. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;Two affidavits to this effect were filed, one by the mother of each of the two children, each sworn in October 2004. It is apparent from these affidavits that the parents are very distressed by the interference with their children. This is perfectly understandable. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;The authorities as to the interpretation of this statute speak with one voice. They are conveniently summarised in the judgment of Whelan&nbsp;J[2], and I will not repeat them. It is sufficient that I note that they emphasise that Parliament permits the suppression of publication of legal proceedings only when, and to the extent that, this is necessary to avoid the harm specified in s80AA. <br />13.&nbsp;Two things must be emphasised. The word “necessary” imposes a high standard. It is not sufficient that it be desirable for the purpose of avoiding the harm. It does not involve weighing the competing interests of the press and the public against that of the complainant. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;The second is that the harm in paragraph&nbsp;(e) is an apprehended harm. The provision presupposes that the undue distress and embarrassment will not occur unless the publication occurs, and even in such an event, there may be uncertainty that it will occur. What the Court is therefore concerned with is whether the order is necessary to avoid an apprehended harm. In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court (NSW)[3], Spigelman&nbsp;CJ, speaking with the concurrence of other members of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, said that the necessity test would not be satisfied by a conclusion that the apprehended harm “could and most probably would” occur. I leave to one side the question of what further degree of certainty that the apprehended harm would occur is required by the statute. It is clear from this and from decisions in this Court such as R v Pomeroy[4] that the circumstances that might warrant the making of an order to avoid the harm mentioned in paragraph&nbsp;(e) are exceptional. Parliament has accepted that there is an overriding public policy that justice be dispensed in public. This policy serves interests which are wider than those of the parties to the litigation, victims of the crime or witnesses. Paragraph&nbsp;(e), which carves out an exception to this policy, speaks only of distress to the “complainant” in specified sexual cases and, further, that the harm to be avoided is that of a distress or embarrassment to them which is undue. What is then required before a suppression order may be made in such a case is such a high degree of satisfaction in the Court that the harm will occur that the making of the order is necessary to avoid it and further, when it is appropriate to make such an order, the order must be couched in terms which are no wider than are necessary to avoid that harm. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;I turn now to the grounds of relief in this case. The first was that the judge failed to form the required opinion and therefore lacked jurisdiction. His Honour mentioned in his Reasons that he was “mindful that a high degree of necessity be shown for an order prohibiting publication of judicial proceeding”[5] and his final conclusion was expressed in these terms:<br />&nbsp;<br />“I am therefore of the opinion that a blanket prohibition is necessary in all the circumstances to protect the innocence of the two children.” [6]</p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;I read this reference to innocence to be a shorthand reference to their lack of knowledge of the sexual assaults to which they had been subjected and, in the context, to the continuance of this ignorance in the future. Even so, this finding of opinion falls far short of that required by s80AA. This, and indeed, any conclusion made by his Honour must be understood against the background that the victim enjoys the protection of s4(1A) of the Judicial Proceeding Reports Act 1958, of which his Honour was also mindful. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Indeed, when his Honour’s Reasons are read as a whole, his expressed apprehension that undue distress or embarrassment might later be suffered to the children showed that he was aware that this is a matter of speculation. He acknowledged that the conclusion assumes that all of the following events occur, each of which was no more than likely to occur:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) Persons within the society of the children or their families will be able to identify the victims from such press reports as are permitted having regard to the Judicial Proceeding Reports Act 1958; not from some other source. <br />(2) These persons will remember the events or will bring them to mind at some time in the future when the children are older and more vulnerable. <br />(3) The facts of the assaults will be disclosed to the children directly or indirectly by those persons. <br />(4) The disclosure will cause the children undue distress or embarrassment.</p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;Whatever may be the certainty that any of these events may occur, it is difficult to see that the prospect that all will occur is of such magnitude that the test laid down by s80AA has been satisfied. It is only where the making of the order is necessary to prevent this, that the Court may act. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;My task for the purposes of this jurisdictional argument is not to form any view as to whether his Honour was correct in concluding that the events are likely to occur without a suppression order. It is to determine whether his Reasons show that his Honour had formed the correct conclusion that the order was necessary to avoid the harm referred to in paragraph&nbsp;(e). Given that he did not in terms say that he formed that opinion, I have considered his Reasons as a whole to determine whether in fact he did. My conclusion is that he did not and, accordingly, the suppression order cannot stand. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;It is therefore not necessary that I consider the alternative argument based on error of law on the face of the record. Nevertheless, in deference to the submissions put and in case this case may go further, I shall venture my views shortly upon this matter. I start from the proposition that his Honour’s Reasons form part of the record[7]. For the reasons which I have ventured to set out at some length, it seems to me that his Honour’s findings do not lead as a matter of law to the conclusion that s80AA requires. As I read his Honour’s judgment, he appears to have concluded that there was a probability that the children might suffer harm in the future. This is not a sufficient basis, as a matter of law, to support the opinion which s80AA requires his Honour to have formed. Accordingly, the second ground is also made out. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;I leave this case with a general reflection. I sympathise with the position of the parents, and it is only with great reluctance that I disturb the order which gives them comfort. It is a very distressing thing to contemplate that one’s children have suffered the harm which is here alleged. It is a very distressing thing to contemplate that in the future this harm might revisit them and cause them distress and embarrassment. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that this is a concern about a harm which may or may not occur in the future. The law has for centuries had a concern that proceedings in court should be conducted in public. This is based on an important public policy which seeks to avoid the spectacle of the secret trial. The interests of individuals must give way to this overriding concern unless the limited exceptions specified by Parliament have been satisfied. They have not been satisfied in this case. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;I propose therefore that the order of the County Court of 28 January 2005 be quashed. In case a fresh application may be made to his Honour I will, if asked, stay the operation of this order for 14 days. I will hear counsel further as to the precise orders that need to be made to give effect to these conclusions, and as to costs. <br />__________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] [2004] VSC 512 <br />[2] [2004] VSC 512 at [19] <br />[3] (2004) 50 ASCR 380 at 398 [96] <br />[4] [2002] VSC 178 (Teague J) <br />[5] Reasons, p3 <br />[6] Reasons, p4 <br />[7] Administrative Law Act 1978, s10.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the Plaintiff Herald &amp; Weekly Times Pty Ltd: Mr WT Houghton QC with Mr DW Bennett, counsel.

In those circumstances, the magistrate was not in error in dismissing the claim against N. </p>\r\n<p>BALMFORD J:<br />Introduction<br />1.&nbsp;This is an appeal on a question of law under section 109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 from a final order made on 22 October 2004 by the Magistrates’ Court at Heidelberg constituted by Mr Hassard, Magistrate, whereby the Magistrate dismissed the appellant’s claim against the respondents and ordered the appellant to pay the respondents’ costs of $5,909.00. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;On 17 December 2004 Master Wheeler ordered the appeal to be brought on the following questions of law:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) Was it open to the learned Magistrate to hold that there was no relevant contractual relationship between the First Respondent and the Appellant?<br />(b) Did the learned Magistrate consider the extent of the warranty (exhibit GK4 to the affidavit of Gabriel Kuek sworn 22 November 2004) particularly as to whether such warranty covered:<br />(i) initial inspection of [sic] and advice; and<br />(ii) consequential damages as a result of work performed.<br />(c) Did the learned Magistrate in weighing up the evidence of the Appellant’s witness [sic] against those of the Respondents, adopt different criteria to wit:<br />(i) in the case of the Appellant’s witness [sic] Pace and Salameh he rejected their evidence because:<br />(a) they were not independent as they were involved in replacing the Appellant’s engine; and<br />(b) their opinions were based upon their reference to a trade manual or a repair manual (being exhibits GK10 GK11 to the said affidavit) which he found to be hearsay:<br />(ii) whereas in respect of the Respondents’ witnesses Herzog and Pianozolla, he relied upon their opinion as experts despite the fact that they had never inspected the relevant engine.</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;After hearing some submissions I ruled that question (c) was not an appropriate question on this appeal, as not raising a question of law, and the matter proceeded on the basis of questions (a) and (b) only. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The first respondent (“Devflan”) carries on a business described as “mechanic and autoelectrical”, trading as “Lubi’s Mobile”. The second respondent (“Mr Nikolovski”) is described in his expert witness statement as “a director of [Devflan] a company which he owns together with his wife”. On 24 March 2003 Mr Nikolovski carried out some repairs on the appellant’s motor vehicle. The repairs involved installing a new timing belt and associated parts. When the work was completed Mr Nikolovski handed an invoice to the appellant, showing total charges of $705.32, which the appellant paid. The heading of the invoice is “Devflan Pty Ltd t/as Lubi’s mobile” and the invoice includes the statement “Warranty 12 months or [illegible to me; found by the Magistrate to be 20,000] km.” <br />5.&nbsp;On 13 May 2003, within the warranty period, the engine of the vehicle broke down, and the timing belt was found to be damaged. The appellant brought proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court at Heidelberg claiming against both respondents damages of $3,855.90 arising from breach of contract and negligence. </p>\r\n<p>Question(a)<br />6.&nbsp;In the course of delivering his oral findings the Magistrate said:<br />&nbsp;<br />First, with whom did the plaintiff contract? As I find the subject contract was with the second named defendant Mr Nikolovski. On his evidence, Mr Kuek initially spoke to Mr Nikolovski by phone after randomly selecting the phone book entry Lubis mobile. Following the first contact phone conversation Mr Nikolovski attended Mr Kuek’s home on Monday the 24th March 2003 and carried out repairs. There is no evidence, indeed no suggestion that the corporate personality, the first named defendant was known to Mr Kuek within the material time frame. The contrary is implicit, for his letter of demand dated the 20th May 2003 was addressed to Lubi’s mobile, notably not the company. I find there was no contractual relationship between the plaintiff and first named defendant, nor is there any evidence to support an action in negligence against it. The claim against the first named defendant is dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;In Spurling v Development Underwriting (Vic) Pty Ltd [1973] VR 1 at 11 Stephen J said:<br />&nbsp;<br />In the case of decisions of magistrates the position in Victoria is well established by a line of decisions culminating in Taylor v Armour &amp; Co Pty Ltd [1962] VR 346, in which the Full Court of this State held that in the case of any question of fact the Court should treat the matter as an appeal from the verdict of a jury and should not make up its own mind upon the evidence but rather confine itself to seeing whether there was evidence upon which the magistrate might, as a reasonable man, come to the conclusion to which he did come. In saying this the Full Court stated that it was following the view of Herring CJ in Young v Paddle Bros Pty Ltd [1956] VLR 38; [1956] ALR 301. The Chief Justice, in that case, adopted as the test whether “on any reasonable view of the evidence that decision can be supported”; a party aggrieved can thus only succeed if a decision contrary to the view of the magistrate is “the only possible decision that the evidence on any reasonable view can support” (see at VLR p41).</p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;I am satisfied, considering the matter on the basis of that passage, that the facts found by the Magistrate are based on evidence upon which he might, as a reasonable man, have come to the conclusion to which he did come. Accordingly, the answer to question (a) must be Yes. </p>\r\n<p>Question (b)<br />9.&nbsp;As to the warranty, the Magistrate said p2:<br />&nbsp;<br />As to contractual sequelae, I find the specific but unelaborated reference to twelve months or twenty thousand kilometres warranty on exhibit A [the invoice] was a warranty as to fitness and service and in effect mimicked the statutory obligation under the Fair Trading Act. In that vein as to the issue of merchantable quality of the components, the plaintiff was confronted with evidence of contemporaneous purchase of new parts from a reputable supplier. As to the quality of the work performed consideration merges with the allegation of negligence.</p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;It is clear that the Magistrate had considered the extent of the warranty to enable him to describe it by reference as mimicking “the statutory obligation under the Fair Trading Act”. That “statutory obligation” derives from the provisions of Part 2A of the Fair Trading Act 1999 (“the Act”), which was inserted in the Act by section 11 of the Fair Trading (Amendment) Act 2003, (“the amending Act”) and came into operation on 1 June 2004, several months before the making of the order here under appeal. I note that the requirement of merchantable quality, to which the Magistrate refers indirectly, is provided for in section 32I of the Act, one of the provisions of Part 2A introduced into the Act by the amending Act. The answer to question (b) is thus also Yes. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;Both remaining questions having been answered in the affirmative, the appeal is dismissed. Counsel may wish to make submissions as to costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />APPEARANCES: For the appellant Kuek: Mr D Perkins, counsel.

As a result of a complaint, N. an inspector with the RSPCA visited the property and saw a number of dead sheep. Subsequently, M. was charged with 7 offences of cruelty under s9 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986. At the hearing before the magistrate, M.''s counsel argued that the particulars given in respect of the charges created uncertainty in that they referred to the same act or omission in relation to different charges. At the conclusion of the case the magistrate found the charges proved and imposed penalties. </p>\r\n<p>M. appealed to the County Court and at the end of legal argument, written submissions were handed to the judge which raised the issues of uncertainty, duplicity or lack of particularity. In his lengthy reasons for judgment, the judge made detailed references to the charges, the defences raised for and on behalf of the appellant, particulars, submissions of counsel and findings. The judge found the matters proved and imposed penalties and an order for costs on the County Court civil scale "D". </p>\r\n<p>Upon application for review—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Application granted in relation to 3 of the charges and the costs order. Such orders quashed and remitted to the County Court for hearing and determination in accordance with law.</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;The degree of detailed reasoning required of a tribunal depends upon the nature of the determination, the complexity of the issues and whether the issues are ones of fact or of law or of mixed fact and law, and the function to be served by the giving of reasons. As to the last matter, reasons which are required to enable a right of appeal on questions of fact to be exercised might not be required if an appeal is limited to questions of law. The extent of the duty to give reasons will depend upon the way in which the case has been conducted. <br />&nbsp;Perkins v County Court of Victoria (2000) 2 VR 246, applied.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The reasons given by the judge in the present case were not inadequate in relation the defences raised by the defence. In the findings made and the way in which certain evidence had been treated, the judge gave sufficient reasons to inform the parties as to the process of his reasoning to the conclusion that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake had not been made out.</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;In relation to the submission that the judge should have preserved a court-made recording of the appeal proceeding so as to amount to a breach of natural justice, there was no evidence as to the completeness or accuracy of the recording nor the resultant detriment from the court''s refusal to make a copy available. In those circumstances the appellant had not been denied natural justice.</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;In relation to the submission that the charges were defective because they were duplicitous, there is no duplicity if a charge refers to one act of cruelty having certain characteristics as opposed to more than one such act. The distinction, broadly speaking, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts, in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. <br />&nbsp;Romeyko v Samuels (1972) 2 SASR 529, applied.<br />5.&nbsp;Where a charge alleged that the appellant did knowingly or negligently do or omit to do an act between certain dates, the charge was defective in that it referred to two offences — by the commission of an act or by an omission with proscribed characteristics. Such a charge was patently duplicitous and could not be saved by the operation of s27(1) or s50(1) or (2) of the Magistrates'' Court Act 1989. Each act of cruelty should have been the subject of a separate charge.</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;The reasons given by the judge for the making of the costs order were inadequate in that there was no explanation given for awarding costs on the County Court civil scale, the scale "D" being the highest, the items included in the calculation of the total, and the reason why the amount of $30,000 was "taxed off".&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>WILLIAMS J:<br />1.&nbsp;This is an application by originating motion for declarations and relief in the nature of certiorari in relation to orders of the second defendant, the County Court of Victoria at Hamilton. The challenged orders were made after an unsuccessful appeal by the plaintiff (“Mrs Mansbridge”) from the decision of the Magistrates Court at Hamilton convicting her of offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 (“the Act”) and awarding costs in favour of the first defendant (“Mr Nichols”). </p>\r\n<p>The material before the Court<br />2.&nbsp;Mrs Mansbridge relies upon her affidavits sworn on 3 December 2003 and 30 April 2004 respectively, together with their exhibits. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Mr Nichols relies upon:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) his affidavit sworn on 23 April 2004; and <br />(b) the affidavits of Michael Russell Coldham of his solicitors sworn on 23 April 2004 and 12 October 2004, respectively, together with their exhibits.</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The second defendant has filed no material and has agreed to abide by the outcome of the application. </p>\r\n<p>The Act<br />5.&nbsp;The Act relevantly provided:<br />&nbsp;<br />“9. Cruelty (1) A person who-... (c) knowingly or negligently does or omits to do an act with the result that unnecessary, unreasonable or unjustifiable pain or suffering is caused to an animal; or ... (f) is the owner of or has the possession or custody of an animal which is confined or otherwise unable to provide for itself and fails to provide the animal with proper and sufficient food, drink and shelter; or ... (i) is the owner of or has the possession or custody of a sick or injured animal and knowingly, negligently or unreasonably fails to provide veterinary or other appropriate attention or treatment for the animal; or ... commits an act of cruelty upon that animal and is guilty of an offence. Penalty: 60 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months. (2) It is a defence to a charge under sub-section (1) against an owner of an animal to prove that, at the time of the alleged offence, the owner had entered into an agreement with another person by which the other person agreed to care for the animal. <br />10. Aggravated cruelty (1) A person who commits an act of cruelty upon any animal which results in the death or serious disablement of the animal commits an act of aggravated cruelty upon that animal and is guilty of an offence. Penalty: 120 penalty units or imprisonment for twelve months. (2) A person who is guilty of an offence under sub-section (1) may be liable to the penalty for that offence in addition to or instead of any other penalty to which the person is liable under section 9.”</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;Mrs Mansbridge was charged with eight offences under the Act and convicted of seven. Because she challenges the formulation of the charges, I will set them out and refer to the particulars provided as well as to relevant submissions made in the Magistrates’ Court and the County Court. </p>\r\n<p>The charges <br />7.&nbsp;The charges were in the following terms:<br />&nbsp;<br />“1. The defendant at Hamilton between 11/08/2001 and 11/09/2001 did commit an act of cruelty upon an animal, to wit a merino sheep, in that she did knowingly or negligently do or omit to do an act with the result that unnecessary, unreasonable or unjustifiable pain or suffering was caused to the animal. <br />2. The defendant at Hamilton between 11/08/2001 and 11/09/2001 did commit an act of cruelty upon an animal, to wit a merino sheep, in that she was the owner of or did have possession or custody of an animal which was confined or otherwise unable to provide for itself and failed to provide the animal with proper and sufficient food, drink and shelter. <br />3. The defendant at Hamilton between 11/08/2001 and 11/09/2001 did commit an act of cruelty upon an animal, to wit a merino sheep, in that she was the owner of or did have possession or custody of a sick or injured animal and knowingly, negligently or unreasonably failed to provide veterinary or other appropriate attention or treatment for the animal. <br />4. The defendant at Hamilton on or around 11/09/2001 did commit an act of aggravated cruelty upon an animal, to wit a merino sheep, in that she did commit an act of cruelty which resulted in the death or serious disablement of the animal. <br />5. The defendant at Hamilton between 11/08/2001 and 11/09/2001 did commit an act of cruelty upon animals, to wit a flock of merino sheep, in that she was the owner of or did have possession or custody of the animals which were confined or otherwise unable to provide for themselves and failed to provide the animals with proper and sufficient food, drink and shelter. <br />6. The defendant at Hamilton between 11/08/2001 and 2/10/2001 did commit an act of cruelty upon animals, to wit a flock of merino sheep, in that she was the owner of or did have possession or custody of sick or injured animals and knowingly, negligently or unreasonably failed to provide veterinary or other appropriate attention or treatment for the animals. <br />7. The defendant at Hamilton on or around 11/09/2001 did commit an act of aggravated cruelty upon animals, to wit 12 merino sheep, in that she did commit an act of cruelty which resulted in the death or serious disablement of the animals.”</p>\r\n<p>The particulars<br />8.&nbsp;After a written request for further and better particulars of the charges, on 20 June 2002 Mr Nichols’ solicitors had supplied Mrs Mansbridge’s solicitors with the following further and better particulars of each of the charges: </p>\r\n<p>A. As to [charge 1]:<br />(i) over a period of time between 11 August 2001 and 11 September 2001. <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton. <br />(iii) (a) failing to provide sufficient food, water and shelter; <br />(b) failing to provide acceptable animal husbandry in the form or appropriate fleece harvesting; <br />(c) failing to administer veterinary treatment in the form of lice and worm control; <br />(d) failure to administer appropriate attention; <br />(e) failure to provide adequate stock numbers for the size and/or condition of the property; <br />(f) failure to destroy any cast animal in a humane manner; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford.</p>\r\n<p>B. As to [charge 2]:<br />(i) over a period of time between 11 August 2001 and 11 September 2001; <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton;<br />(iii) (a) failing to provide sufficient food, water and shelter;<br />(b) failure to provide adequate stock numbers for the size and/or condition of the property; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford.</p>\r\n<p>C. As to [charge 3]:<br />(i) over a period of time between 11 August 2001 and 11 September 2001; <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton;<br />(iii) (a) failing to administer veterinary treatment in the form of lice and worm control;<br />(b) failure to administer appropriate attention; <br />(c) failure to destroy any cast animal in a humane manner; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford.</p>\r\n<p>D. As to [charge 4]:<br />(i) on 11 September 2001; <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton;<br />(iii) (a) failing to provide sufficient food, water and shelter;<br />(b) failing to provide acceptable animal husbandry in the form or appropriate fleece harvesting; <br />(c) failing to administer veterinary treatment in the form of lice and worm control; <br />(d) failure to administer appropriate attention; <br />(e) failure to provide adequate stock numbers for the size and/or condition of the property; <br />(f) failure to destroy any cast animal in a humane manner; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford.<br />E. As to [charge 5]:<br />(i) over a period of time between 11 August 2001 and 11 September 2001; <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton.<br />(iii) (a) failing to provide sufficient food, water and shelter;<br />(b) failure to provide adequate stock numbers for the size and/or condition of the property; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford.</p>\r\n<p>F. As to [charge 6]:<br />(i) over a period of time between 11 August 2001 and 2 October 2001; <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton<br />(iii) (a) failing to administer veterinary treatment in the form of lice and worm control;<br />(b) failure to administer appropriate attention; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford.</p>\r\n<p>G. As to [charge 7]:<br />(i) on 11 September 2001; <br />(ii) on the defendant’s property at 4985 Strathkellar Road, Hamilton;<br />(iii) (a) failing to provide sufficient food, water and shelter;<br />(b) failing to provide acceptable animal husbandry in the form or appropriate fleece harvesting; <br />(c) failing to administer veterinary treatment in the form of lice and worm control; <br />(d) failure to administer appropriate attention; <br />(e) failure to provide adequate stock numbers for the size and/or condition of the property; <br />(f) failure to destroy any cast animal in a humane manner; <br />(iv) from the observations and statements of Inspector Nichols and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford and the post-mortem results obtained by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford; <br />(“the particulars”). </p>\r\n<p>Background<br />9.&nbsp;Mr Nichols, an inspector employed by the RSPCA, was the informant in the prosecution of Mrs Mansbridge in the Magistrates’ Court. A report had been received by him from a Mr Warburton in relation to a number of dead sheep he had observed in a paddock on Mrs Mansbridge’s Hamilton property when riding his motorcycle in the vicinity. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;On 11 September 2001 Mr Nichols attended the property in the company of a District Veterinary Officer, Dr Rainsford, and two police officers. The party had inspected the subject sheep and photographs were taken by Mr Nichols. Dr Rainsford conducted an autopsy on one of the dead sheep (“the post-mortem sheep”) and took samples from five other dead sheep. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;At the hearing of the charges at the Magistrates’ Court, on 10 October 2002, the issue of the sufficiency of the particulars was raised by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge and by counsel representing her husband (“Mr Mansbridge”). Mr Mansbridge also faced charges relating to the subject sheep at that time, although those charges were subsequently withdrawn after Mrs Mansbridge’s ownership of the sheep was established. The transcript of the relevant exchanges between counsel and the Magistrate was exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Nichols. Each party sought to use it to support submissions in this Court as to whether or not Mrs Mansbridge had been denied procedural fairness in the County Court appeal. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;The sheep the subject of each charge were identified in the Magistrates’ Court at the request of counsel for Mrs Mansbridge. Her counsel also argued that the particulars created uncertainty, in that they might have referred to the same act or omission in relation to different charges. He mentioned the possibility of resulting “overt duplicity” but went on to say:<br />&nbsp;<br />“But until someone actually turns their mind to it it’s very hard to run a case such as this. But, look, ordinarily - my friend knows his case, he will probably be able to tell you- just say how it is that he puts his case and if he can point to an act of what he says to be cruelty in relation to any particular animal it might be something we can just cope with.”</p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge submitted that it was duplicitous “to put a number of sets of facts and encompass those in one charge”. He urged the court to order particulars in relation to the charges or to strike them out and allow the prosecution to file fresh charges. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols contended that the defence was trying to delay the proceeding for tactical reasons. He maintained that the particulars in relation to each charge were not identical, as had been asserted. He submitted that he could not make an election because s 9(1) of the Act set out the different ingredients of the different proscribed acts of cruelty. He suggested that the evidence should be called and that counsel for Mrs Mansbridge and her husband could seek to have the matter stood down if they were “embarrassed about anything”. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;His Worship accepted the prosecution’s submissions that each charge was quite separate. He refused to adjourn the hearing. Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge stated that he did not want an adjournment. More discussion ensued and eventually the evidence commenced, with the apparent concurrence of counsel for Mrs Mansbridge. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;The particulars were amended, by consent, before the commencement of the evidence, by the deletion of the references to shelter in charges 2 and 5. Although no amendment was made, counsel for Mr Nichols also informed the court that he would not rely upon the reference in paragraph (c) of the particulars to charge 3 to “failure to destroy any cast animal in a humane manner.” I note at this point, however, that counsel for Mr Nichols told this Court that his recollection was that he did not rely upon that particular of any of the charges, apart from the first. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;The Magistrate convicted Mrs Mansbridge of seven offences under the Act and dismissed the eighth charge. She appealed from the orders to the County Court. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;It was common ground that there was no evidence of the issues of uncertainty, lack of particularity or duplicity being raised in oral argument in the County Court. Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge, however, contended in this Court that he did raise the issues in the County Court in written submissions handed up at the end of the argument (“the written submissions”). In so far as it was necessary for the purposes of her case, counsel for Mrs Mansbridge argued that the written submissions were incorporated into the record by his Honour’s acknowledgment that he had read them. </p>\r\n<p>The written submissions <br />19.&nbsp;The written submissions included the following statements relied upon by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) as to charge 1: <br />“This charge is in relation to the cast sheep ''in the sticks'' or ''paddling'' sheep. <br />The precise crime in (sic) unstated but it is presumed to be failing to inspect the sheep often enough.”: <br />(b) as to charges 3 and 6: <br />“It is to be noted that only one act or omission can be contained in the one charge. The prosecution is not permitted to switch from knowingly to negligently to unreasonably at whim. <br />The omission should be specified.” <br />(c) as to charge 4: <br />“This charge subsumes all the elements in charge 2 or in the alternative charge 3, and requires further proof that the act or omission must have ''resulted in'', in this case, death. <br />... <br />The inadequacies in charges 2 and 3 are all present in this charge. <br />(d) as to charge 7: <br />“This charge subsumes all the elements in charge 5 or in the alternative charge 6, and requires further proof that the act or omission must have ''resulted in'', in this case, death.”</p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge submitted that he would have addressed the issues of uncertainty, duplicity or lack of particularity in his oral submissions to his Honour, but conceded that the Court could not take that submission into account as evidence of the fact that the alleged oral submissions had been made. The submission was contested by counsel for Mr Nichols, but no relevant evidence was adduced by either side. </p>\r\n<p>The reasons <br />21.&nbsp;On appeal, Mrs Mansbridge was convicted again of the seven offences the subject of the Magistrates’ Court convictions. She was fined the sum of $1000 in relation to the convictions in respect of each of the charges of commission of an act of cruelty under s 9(1) of the Act and fined $2000 in relation to each of the two charges of aggravated cruelty. She was also disqualified from having custody of any sheep for a period of two years from 30 August 2003 and ordered to pay costs in the sum of $55,000. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;The judgment of the County Court was delivered on 14 July 2003. In his reasons for decision (“the reasons”) his Honour made detailed reference to the evidence on the appeal. The reasons were recorded in Mrs Mansbridge’s 3 December 2003 affidavit, as well as in those filed on behalf of Mr Nichols. To the extent that the material was inconsistent, it was agreed that the version provided by Mr Coldham should be adopted. The reasons are too lengthy to be included in full, but I will set out relevant parts. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;A significant section of the reasons contained most of his Honour’s findings and conclusions. Mr&nbsp;Coldham’s 23 April 2004 affidavit records that after referring to the evidence, his Honour went on to say:<br />&nbsp;<br />“(cc) The charges were as follows: * Count 1 - Sticks sheep [ a sheep found cast down in an area of the property known as “the sticks”]. * Count 2 - Post-mortem sheep * Count 3 - Post-mortem sheep * Count 4 - Post-mortem sheep * Count 5 - Other sheep (apart from the post-mortem sheep) * Count 6 - The 12 carcases * Count 7 - The 12 carcases. I note the following findings on all the evidence. (1) The paddock pasture was billiard table like and inadequate; (2) The paddock pasture was overburdened substantially by excessive flock numbers on 11 September 2002; (3) There was no evidence of supplementary feeding to be seen in the paddock; (4) If any supplementary feeding did take place it was inadequate; (5) The sheep were ‘hollow’; (6) The sheep were ‘confined’ in terms of s.9(1)(f) of the Act, despite the condition of the boundary fence along the railway line; (7) The sheep suffered from lice infestation; (8) The sheep numbered four or five in the samples sent to Gribbles Pathology for analysis were found to have carried a ‘high’ or ‘very high’ parasite burden; (9) Many of the sheep in the flock were overburdened with wool, and had not been shorn for at least 14 months or more; (10) The wool burdened sheep had not been crutched, pizzled or wigged; (11) There were 13 carcases in the paddock on 11 September 2001 on the visit by the RSPCA inspector, Mr&nbsp;Nichols, and Dr&nbsp;Rainsford, the District Veterinarian Officer; (12) The sheep described by Sean Mansbridge in his evidence as the ‘sticks’ sheep was not humanely disposed of [when it should have been] and struggled for a long time before it died; (13) The sheep the subject of the post-mortem examination conducted by Dr&nbsp;Rainsford was heavily infected with parasites; (14) The sheep were not adequately drenched. (dd) To describe the sheep as in an appalling condition is an understatement. Mr&nbsp;Warburton could observe their condition to such a level that he reported their condition to the RSPCA. Mrs&nbsp;Mansbridge made no attempt to observe her flock of sheep. If she had done so on 10 or 11 September 2001, she would have seen what Mr&nbsp;Warburton had seen. Mrs&nbsp;Mansbridge was grossly negligent in the care of the sheep. Counts 4 and 7 elements are made out. I find the offences proved.”</p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;Mrs Mansbridge sought to rely upon a defence under s9(2) of the Act, as well as a defence of honest and reasonable mistake in a state of facts which if true would have resulted in her acquittal; see: He Kaw Teh v the Queen[1]. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;She based her argument that the statutory defence was available upon an alleged agreement with her son, Mr Sean Mansbridge, to the effect that he would care for the subject sheep during the relevant period. Her defence of honest and reasonable mistake would appear to have been grounded upon her alleged belief that Mr Sean Mansbridge was caring properly for the animals. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;It was common ground that the following passage from the 23 April 2004 Coldham affidavit should be adopted as reflecting what was said by his Honour in relation to the alleged statutory defence:<br />&nbsp;<br />“There is a specific defence under the Act under s9(2). That is not an excuse, but a defence. I find this defence is not available, on Mrs&nbsp;Mansbridge’s and Sean’s evidence. The terms of the agreement were that Mrs&nbsp;Mansbridge said ‘I cannot handle both situations and was he willing to help me’. There was some attempt in re-examination of Mrs&nbsp;Mansbridge to rescue the conversation. Sean adopted his mother’s evidence.”</p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;In an exchange between his Honour and counsel for Mrs Mansbridge, after submissions had been made in relation to penalty, counsel for Mrs Mansbridge asked whether his Honour had read the written submissions provided by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge on the last sitting day of the hearing. His Honour confirmed that he had. Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge inquired as to whether the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was available in relation to the charges. His Honour stated that it was. When asked whether the defence applied to the case, his Honour stated that it did not. In response to an inquiry his Honour stated that he had found that a request had been made by Mrs Mansbridge but that no agreement had been made. </p>\r\n<p>The grounds<br />28.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge initially relied upon a written statement of the grounds for relief. After submissions from each party, counsel for Mrs Mansbridge produced a more abbreviated statement of the grounds dated 22 October 2004 (“the grounds”) which incorporated changes and additional matters which had been canvassed in his oral argument. He relied upon his initial written statement of grounds in relation to his arguments about the challenged orders as to costs. </p>\r\n<p>The alleged defences<br />29.&nbsp;The grounds first challenged the court’s failure to find that alleged defences had been established. It was initially put in the grounds that, having heard certain submissions by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge and having made a certain finding of fact, the court had erred by not finding the defences established. However, counsel for Mrs Mansbridge abandoned that argument during the course of his oral submissions. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge nevertheless urged the Court to quash the convictions on the basis that the reasons for the findings that neither defence was made out were inadequate and amounted to a “constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction” or an error of law apparent on the face of the record. He also argued that the court’s failure to preserve and make available the tape recording of the hearing constituted a breach of a “fundamental requirement of natural justice”. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols argued that his Honour had given sufficient reasons for his decisions in light of the charges, the particulars, the evidence and the arguments put to him on the appeal which were referred to in the judgment. Counsel also submitted that the learned judge had no obligation to make available an internal recording of proceedings made by the Court. He argued that, as his Honour had read from notes, it was reasonable to infer that his reasons had been recorded and he noted that Mrs Mansbridge had made no request for the notes. </p>\r\n<p>The duty to give reasons<br />32.&nbsp;In Perkins v County Court of Victoria[2] Buchanan&nbsp;JA (with whom Phillips and Charles&nbsp;JJA agreed) expressed the view that the requirements of natural justice did not extend to the form in which a decision was pronounced. Buchanan JA also held that there was no general principle that a court’s failure to give reasons amounted to a vitiating error of law[3]. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;Buchanan&nbsp;JA considered the criteria for the adequacy of reasons stating[4]:<br />&nbsp;<br />“The degree of detailed reasoning required of a tribunal depends upon the nature of the determination, the complexity of the issues and whether the issues are ones of fact or of law or of mixed fact and law, and the function to be served by the giving of reasons. As to the last matter, reasons which are required to enable a right of appeal on questions of fact to be exercised might not be required if an appeal is limited to questions of law. ... The extent of the duty to give reasons will depend upon the way in which the case has been conducted. A judge may properly limit himself to determining facts which are in issue and dealing with the points which have been taken and the submissions made in relation to them. (See Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd at 270 per Mahoney JA) The court conducting a judicial review by way of certiorari is limited to the record of the court or tribunal subject to the review. The evidence and the submissions made to the County Court judge can be considered only if they emerge from the record of the County Court and, as will be seen, the record extends no further than the judge’s reasons.” </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;In Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd[5] McHugh JA had noted that it was beside the point that a finding was erroneous:<br />&nbsp;<br />“What is decisive is that his Honour’s judgment reveals the ground for, although not the detailed reasoning in support of, his finding of fact. But that is enough in a case where no appeal lies against the finding of fact.”</p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols submitted that it was evident from his Honour’s findings of fact and his conclusions that neither the defence under s9(2) nor that based upon an honest and reasonable mistake had been made out. <br />Constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction<br />36.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge relied upon the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Fleet v District Court of NSW &amp; Ors[6], urging the Court to find that his Honour had constructively failed to exercise his jurisdiction as a result of the inadequacy of the reasons in relation to the alleged defences and in other respects. </p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;In Fleet the defendant challenged his conviction by a District Court judge of an offence of aggravated cruelty to a dog under s6(1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 (NSW). An act of “aggravated cruelty upon an animal” was committed under s4(3) of the New South Wales statute if a person committed an act of cruelty upon the animal resulting in its death, deformity or serious disablement or it being in such a physical condition that it was cruel to keep it alive. In a joint judgment, Mason&nbsp;P, Priestley and Handley&nbsp;JJA examined the judge’s findings and, in the paragraph relied upon by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge throughout his submissions, said: </p>\r\n<p>“50. The problem with these findings on the aggravated cruelty charge is that they bear no direct relationship to the elements of the offence as disclosed in the statute. There was no finding of a specific fact or omission, no finding of contravention of any identifiable part of s5(3) [setting out ways of committing such an act], and no finding of the causal factor in s4(3). These absences may in large part have been due to the blatantly ambiguous form of the charge and the lack of assistance given to her Honour by the prosecution. However, the absence of findings on critical aspects of the complicated offence means that the learned judge constructively failed to exercise her jurisdiction (Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council (1947) 47 S.R. (NSW) 416 at 420; Re Wakim; ex parte McNally (1999) 73 ALJR 839 at [102]).”</p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;In the passage referred to by their Honours in Ex parte Hebburn Ltd Jordan CJ said: </p>\r\n<p>“It was contended, however, that ... at the worst all that the magistrate had done was to make a mistake of law in construing the section, and the fact that a tribunal has made such a mistake in exercising its jurisdiction does not amount in law to a constructive failure to exercise it. I quite agree that the mere fact that a tribunal has made a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction of a statute, does not necessarily constitute a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction: R v Minister of Health [1939] 1 KB 232 at 245-6). But there are mistakes and mistakes; and if a mistake of law as to the proper construction of a statute investing a tribunal with jurisdiction leads it to misunderstand the nature of the jurisdiction which it is to exercise and to apply ''a wrong and inadmissible test'': Estate and Trust Agencies (1927) Ltd v Singapore Investment Trust ([1937] AC 898 at 917); or to ''misconceive its duty'' or ''not to apply itself to the question which the law prescribes'':The King v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal ((1933) 50 CLR 228 at 242-3; or ''to misunderstand the nature of the opinion which it is to form'': The King v Connell ((1944) 69 CLR 407 at 432), in giving a decision in exercise of its jurisdiction or authority, a decision so given will be regarded as given in purported and not real exercise of jurisdiction, leaving the jurisdiction in law constructively unexercised and the tribunal liable to the issue of a prerogative writ of mandamus to hear and determine the matter according to law: R v Board of Education ([1910] 2 KB 165.”</p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols disputed the contention that his Honour had failed to exercise his jurisdiction. He made detailed reference to the charges, the particulars, the submissions of counsel, the findings of the County Court and to his Honour’s conclusions. He submitted that the court had made appropriate findings and had addressed the correct questions, generally, and, in particular, in relation to the argued defences. </p>\r\n<p>Conclusion <br />40.&nbsp;I am not persuaded that the reasons were inadequate in relation to the alleged defences. It follows that I am not persuaded that his Honour constructively failed to exercise his jurisdiction in the sense in which the court found had been the case in Fleet. </p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;In my view, it can be discerned from the reasons that his Honour found that there had been a request made by Mrs Mansbridge that Mr Sean Mansbridge assist her in caring for the sheep, but that the requisite agreement under s9(2) of the Act had not been made and so the statutory defence had not been made out. </p>\r\n<p>42.&nbsp;It is also apparent that having made those findings, his Honour took the view that the prosecution had proved that Mrs Mansbridge had not held an honest and reasonable belief that Mr Sean Mansbridge was caring properly for the subject sheep. As counsel for Mr Nichols pointed out, his Honour had also found that Mrs Mansbridge had not inspected the sheep during the relevant period and that she had, therefore, been unable to disagree with the evidence of Dr Rainsford’s observations as to their state on 11 September 2001. His Honour referred to Mrs Mansbridge’s evidence that she could have checked the condition of the sheep, but did not do so. He also noted Mr Sean Mansbridge’s evidence to the effect that he had agreed with his mother’s evidence that she had told him that she could not deal with the sheep and had asked whether he was willing to assist. </p>\r\n<p>43.&nbsp;I note that, when questioning his Honour about the availability of the defence, counsel for Mrs Mansbridge addressed the issue by directing his enquiries to the existence of both a request that assistance be given and the making of an agreement between mother and son. There was no reference in the reasons, or in the questions asked by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge, to any other direct evidence of the alleged mistaken belief, apart from that which related to the alleged agreement and must have been rejected. </p>\r\n<p>44.&nbsp;In light of the description of the ambit of the requirement to give reasons for decision in the authorities, the court’s findings and his Honour’s general rejection of the evidence of Mr Sean Mansbridge, in my view, his Honour gave sufficient reasons to inform the parties as to the process of his reasoning to the conclusion that the defence of honest and reasonable mistake was not made out. </p>\r\n<p>45.&nbsp;In the context of his submissions relating to the adequacy of the findings as to the alleged defences, counsel for Mrs Mansbridge also submitted that his Honour should have preserved a court-made recording of the proceeding and that his failure to do so represented a breach of “a fundamental requirement of natural justice”. He relied upon the decision in Wood v Marsh[7] when arguing that a tribunal of fact exercising criminal jurisdiction should ensure that adequate reasons are given at the time the decision is made and are properly recorded. </p>\r\n<p>46.&nbsp;In Wood v Marsh Malcolm CJ was referring to a challenge to the decision of Justices of the Peace on the basis that no reasons for decision had been given. In a passage relied upon by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge to establish a duty to provide the recording, the Chief Justice stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“In the present case, there is no record of the reasons or sentencing remarks of the Justices. Where there are no recording facilities available, it is important that the Justices ensure that they or an officer of the Court makes a note of the reasons for decision and sentence in any case. It is a fundamental requirement of natural justice that a tribunal of fact, particular one exercising criminal jurisdiction, should ensure that adequate reasons, whether for conviction or for sentence are given at the time the decision is made and properly recorded: cf Hasting v Hall (1997) 94 A Crim R&nbsp;437 at 443 and 444 per Anderson J; and Ladlow v Hayes (1983) 8 A Crim R&nbsp;377 at 388 and 389 per Walters J.”</p>\r\n<p>47.&nbsp;Counsel was unable to point to any other authorities supporting his argument. </p>\r\n<p>48.&nbsp;I am not persuaded that I ought to find that his Honour denied natural justice to Mrs Mansbridge by refusing to hand over the internal tape recording of the proceedings before him. Even if the failure to provide an accurate recording of a hearing could constitute a denial of natural justice, there was no evidence as to the completeness or accuracy of any recording made and the resulting benefit or detriment to the parties from the court’s refusal to make it available. This is not a case where no reasons had been provided, as was Wood v Marsh. Further, there was no evidence as to any injustice caused to Mrs Mansbridge, in the circumstances in which she had been represented at the hearing and both she and the solicitor for Mr Nichols had been able to provide evidence on affidavit in relation to the lengthy reasons provided by his Honour. Moreover, I take into account that I was informed by counsel that there had been no request made to the court for any notes made by his Honour. </p>\r\n<p>Duplicity<br />49.&nbsp;The grounds went on to deal in turn with each of the convictions, arguing that they should be quashed for a number of reasons. </p>\r\n<p>50.&nbsp;Each of the charges was said to have been defective because it was patently and latently duplicitous. It was put that, as a result of the alleged duplicity there was: <br />(a) an error of law apparent on the face of the record; and <br />(b) jurisdictional error by failure to accord procedural unfairness. </p>\r\n<p>Charge 1<br />51.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge argued that charge 1 was patently duplicitous as it alleged that an act of cruelty had been committed by Mrs Mansbridge as “she did knowingly or negligently do or omit to do an act” between certain dates. He submitted that a number of offences were encompassed within that allegation, as it was not clear whether an act or an omission was the subject of the charge and what state of mind was alleged. </p>\r\n<p>52.&nbsp;There will be no duplicity if a charge refers to one act of cruelty having certain characteristics, as opposed to more than one such act. The relevant distinction was pointed out by Bray CJ in Romeyko v Samuels[8]: </p>\r\n<p>“The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts, in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. Of course, there will always be borderline cases and if it is clear that Parliament intended several offences to be committed if the act in question possesses more than one of the forbidden characteristics, that result will follow.”</p>\r\n<p>53.&nbsp;In my view, the reference to the relevant state of mind described a characteristic of the proscribed act or omission constituting an offence under s9 (1)(c) of the Act. However, I consider that charge 1 should have specified what offence Mrs Mansbridge had committed, whether by her act or by a failure to act. On its face, the charge might arguably be defective as patently duplicitous by referring to two offences: by the commission of an act or by an omission with the proscribed characteristics. It also might be open to challenge as lacking sufficient particulars to identify the crime alleged against Mrs Mansbridge. </p>\r\n<p>54.&nbsp;In Walsh v R [9] Phillips and Buchanan JJA explained at [40]: </p>\r\n<p>“As we apprehend it, a count is bad for duplicity if it charges more than one offence; on the other hand, if the count charges but one offence and evidence is led of more than one instance of such offending, then the verdict, if against the accused, will be uncertain. This last is sometimes called latent uncertainty because it depends, not so much upon the terms of the count, as upon the case sought to be made by the Crown. Suffice it to refer in this connection to Johnson v Miller ((1937) 59 CLR 467) and R v Trotter ((1982) 7 A Crim R 8).”</p>\r\n<p>55.&nbsp;In Johnson v Miller[10] the complaint alleged one offence of selling alcohol from a hotel after hours. The particulars failed to select one sale and evidence was led of a number of occurrences each of which might have constituted a separate offence. Dixon J held that the facts fell “almost exactly” within the statement of Napier J in Tucker v Noblet[11] which his Honour quoted at the start of the following passage from his judgment:<br />&nbsp;<br />“''It may be possible that a case could occur in which the complaint is good'', that is, I take it, apparently good if read apart from the circumstances of the case ''but evidence is admitted which gives rise to duplicity or uncertainty, and where there is some grave embarrassment or prejudice of such a character that it cannot be fairly met by any adjournment. If that should happen and the prosecutor should refuse to elect, I think that the court must have some inherent power to secure a fair trial and to prevent an abuse of its process. If all other means fail, the inherent power may extend so far as to justify a dismissal of the complaint: O’Flaherty v McBride ((1920) 28 CLR at p288). But that could only be as a last resort, and in a very unusual case.'' ... in many cases, evidence of more than one offence cannot be admitted, and under one charge to take evidence of a number of separate instances of the commission of the same offence because each will indifferently fit the complaint is to pursue a course contrary to law. It cannot be enough to require the complainant to elect among the instances he has proved until after his evidence has been given in full. Where an information is so drawn as to disclose more than one offence and one set of facts amounts to each of the various offences covered by the charge, ... the proper course is to put the complainant to his election. In such a case to wait to the end of his evidence before doing so may cause no injustice. But it is the converse in the present case, where the question is whether the prosecutor should not be required to identify one of a number of sets of facts, each amounting to the commission of the same offence as that on which the charge is based. In my opinion he clearly should be required to identify the transaction upon which he relies and he should be so required as soon as it appears that his complaint, in spite of its apparent particularity, is equally capable of referring to a number of occurrences each of which constitutes the offence, the legal nature of which is described in the complaint. For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. The court hearing a complaint or information for an offence must also have before it a means of identifying with the matter or transaction alleged in the document the matter or transaction appearing in evidence.”[12]</p>\r\n<p>56.&nbsp;Dixon J held that there would be a defect in the particularity of a complaint in circumstances of latent ambiguity where there had been no indication given by amendment, in particulars or by an election, as to which transaction, occasion or occurrence was its subject. </p>\r\n<p>S 27(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989<br />57.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols argued that, properly construed, s9(1)(c) created only one offence. He also responded generally that the charge was properly framed in light of the provisions of s27(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 (“the Magistrates’ Court Act”) as it followed the wording of s9(1)(c) of the Act. </p>\r\n<p>58.&nbsp;S 27(1) relevantly provided:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Description in charge 27 <br />(1) A charge must describe the offence which the defendant is alleged to have committed and a description of an offence in the words of the Act or subordinate instrument creating it, or in similar words, is sufficient.”</p>\r\n<p>59.&nbsp;In Stanton v Abernathy[13] the Court of Appeal of the New South Wales Supreme Court considered the validity of an information charging the defendant with one offence of giving evidence which he knew to be false. Gleeson CJ, with whom Priestley and Meagher JJA agreed, considered the operation of s145A of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW), an equivalent of s27(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act. The Chief Justice held that s145A “does not do away with the common law requirement that an information must identify the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence alleged to have been committed: Smith v Moody [1903] 1 KB 56; Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 and Ex parte Graham Re Dowling (1968) 88 WN (NSW)270; [1969] 1 NSWR 231.”[14] His Honour went on to note that the courts had failed to precisely define the circumstances in which s145A would save an information. </p>\r\n<p>60.&nbsp;It is a question of the proper construction of the statute as to whether or not it creates more than one offence. Alternative ways of committing the one offence may be the subject of a charge; see: R v Ginies[15]. However, in my view, charge 1 was defective, either because it was patently duplicitous, in that it referred to both an act and an omission by Mrs Mansbridge with certain forbidden characteristics. I am not persuaded that s27 (1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act saved it. </p>\r\n<p>The effect of the particulars<br />61.&nbsp;The particulars referred to omissions, rather than acts, but did not cure the defect by identifying one transaction or occurrence constituting the alleged subject omission. Indeed, the particulars specified a number of omissions constituting a number of separate offences as the subject matter of the charge. Subsequently, evidence relevant to a number of different offences was led. Accordingly, the particulars and the evidence revealed that charge 1 was also latently duplicitous or ambiguous. </p>\r\n<p>S 50(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989<br />62.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols sought to call in aid the provisions of s50(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act to argue that any defect of lack of particularity would not have deprived the court of jurisdiction to convict Mrs Mansbridge. He relied upon the interpretation by Brennan J in John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General for New South Wales[16] of a similarly worded provision in s6(1) of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967 (NSW). </p>\r\n<p>63.&nbsp;S50 of the Magistrates’ Court Act relevantly provided:<br />&nbsp;<br />“50. Power to amend where there is a defect or error <br />(1) On the hearing of a proceeding the Court must not allow an objection to a charge, summons or warrant on account of any defect or error in it in substance or in form or for any variance between it and the evidence presented in the proceeding but the Court may amend the charge, summons or warrant to correct the defect or error. (2) An order must not be set aside or quashed only because of a defect or error in form but the Court may amend the order to correct the defect or error.”</p>\r\n<p>64.&nbsp;In Stanton v Abernathy and Anor[17] the information was held to be defective because of lack of particularity and latent duplicity. Gleeson CJ referred to s30 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW), a provision in similar terms to those of s50(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act, and to relevant authorities, including John, and concluded that the technical invalidity of the information was overcome by s30. His Honour noted that the requirements of natural justice might however necessitate an order for particulars.[18] </p>\r\n<p>65.&nbsp;He then went on to consider the effect of the duplicity:<br />&nbsp;<br />“In relation to the matter of duplicity, the relevant authorities are not easy to reconcile. There is a line of cases, commencing with Rodgers v Richards [1892] 1 QB 555, and continuing through Ex parte Williams (1909) 9 SR (NSW) 140; 26 WN (NSW) 9, and Hedberg v Woodhall, which hold that duplicity is a defect in substance of a kind that falls squarely within the language of s30 and corresponding provisions elsewhere, and that a magistrate may not dismiss an information simply on the ground of duplicity. There is another line of cases, including Edwards v Jones [1947] KB 659; Byrne v Baker [1964] VR 443; Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling; R v Elliott (1974) 8 SASR 329 and Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [1988] VR 411, which hold that when a magistrate is confronted with an information which suffers from the defect of duplicity he or she should require the prosecution to elect, and if no election is made then the information is to be regarded as bad and should be dismissed. Attempts at reconciliation of the authorities are not made easier by references in the second group of cases to the possibility that those in the first group are no longer good law. However, as was noted above, Brennan J in the High Court has very recently followed and applied Hedberg v Woodhall.”[19]</p>\r\n<p>66.&nbsp;His Honour held that the High Court’s decision in Johnson v Miller[20] was applicable. He referred to the magistrate’s duty to act fairly in a committal hearing and continued to state:<br />&nbsp;<br />“The authorities do not in my view justify a conclusion that the information is incurably defective, or not such as to found jurisdiction in the magistrate. However, the proper course now to be pursued, it being apparent that the prosecutor is alleging more than one offence, is for the prosecution to be required both to give further and better particulars in accordance with the following portion of this judgment, and either elect to charge the appellant with making one false statement to the exclusion of any others, or alternatively to frame and propound additional charges, laying one charge in respect of each alleged false statement. If the prosecution declines to adopt either of those courses, then the information should be dismissed.”[21]</p>\r\n<p>67.&nbsp;In this case there was no amendment of the charge, the particulars revealed ambiguity and no election was made by the informant after submissions pointing out the vice of the duplicitous nature of the charge by counsel for Mr and Mrs Mansbridge in the Magistrates’ Court. The charge was not dismissed. The matter was not dealt with in the County Court and his Honour made his findings and convicted Mrs Mansbridge on the first charge, without specifying which crime was its subject, despite the reference in the written submissions to the nature of the offence not having been specified. </p>\r\n<p>68.&nbsp;Each act of cruelty should have been the subject of a separate charge. In Walsh v Tattersall[22] Kirby J held that the statute allegedly contravened by the appellant created a separate offence each time a prohibited benefit payment was obtained and that the subject count was defective because of latent duplicity. Kirby J described the effect of the latent duplicity when he concluded:<br />&nbsp;<br />“As in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 498), the present appellant has few merits on his side; except legal merits, which are sufficient. This Court should adhere to its longstanding insistence that, save for statutory warrant and for the exceptional cases of continuing offences or facts so closely related that they amount to one activity, separate offences should be the subject of separate charges. The Act under which the appellant was charged clearly contemplated that obtaining each payment or benefit was a separate offence. Each should have been the subject of a separate charge. This was apparently the original intention of the police and perhaps the prosecutor. Unwisely and in my view, unlawfully, it was departed from. That departure resulted in a count which manifested the defect of latent duplicity. The significance of that defect was not really demonstrated until all of the evidence was produced. The result was that nobody — prosecutor, accused or magistrate — directed attention, or sufficient attention, to the ingredients of each individual offence. That is enough to strike at the validity of the trial.” [23]</p>\r\n<p>69.&nbsp;Notwithstanding any effect of s50(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act in relation to the charge itself, I consider that the conviction in relation to charge 1 was uncertain and there was a resulting denial of procedural fairness to Mrs Mansbridge. The conviction is therefore, liable to be quashed; see: S v R[24]; R v Trotter[25]. </p>\r\n<p>S50(2) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989<br />70.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols, however, sought to rely upon what might be described as a privative provision in s50 (2) of the Magistrates’ Court Act in support of an argument that certiorari would not lie to quash any of the challenged convictions, including that relating to charge 1, because the defect or error in the order was one of form. He relied upon the characterisation of the defect in a duplicitous charge as one of form by Kirby J and by Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment in Walsh v Tattersall [26]. </p>\r\n<p>71.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge responded that the error was one going to the jurisdiction of the County Court and that a privative provision would not operate to deprive the Court of the power to grant certiorari, unless it did so in explicit terms[27]. He relied upon Byrne v Baker[28] and Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd[29] to argue that the defect of duplicity in the charge went to the jurisdiction of the court and that, accordingly, certiorari would remain available in the absence of express words depriving the Court of its power to issue the writ. </p>\r\n<p>72.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols responded that the Full Court in Byrne v Baker[30] had decided that prohibition was available because a denial of natural justice had resulted from the duplicity in the information and that it had expressly declined to decide as to the correctness of two cases in the Divisional Court[31] in which duplicity had been held to deprive justices of jurisdiction to allow an amendment or to proceed to conviction. He also referred to Gleeson CJ’s summary of the authorities relating to the effect of a duplicitous charge in Stanton v Abernathy </p>\r\n<p>73.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge referred to the Full Court decision in R v Chairman of General Sessions at Hamilton; ex parte Atterby[32] in which s164 of the Justices Act 1957 was relied upon to prevent the quashing of a decision of the Hamilton court of petty sessions in circumstances in which it was held that there had been a denial of natural justice in the hearing. S164 made specific reference to the availability of certiorari providing that no proceeding “touching any order made ... - shall be vacated or quashed for want of form or be removed ... by certiorari or any other writ or process whatsoever into the Supreme Court”. Lowe J held that the denial of procedural fairness was analogous to a defect of jurisdiction in relation to which relief by certiorari would remain available in accordance with a Privy Council ruling in Colonial Bank of Australasia v Willan[33]. </p>\r\n<p>74.&nbsp;In Atterby[34] Smith J held that there had been a want of jurisdiction on another basis, but relevantly also stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“But I do not desire to be taken as expressing any dissent from the view that if there is, in some fundamental respect, a denial of the rights ordinarily allowed to a party in judicial proceedings, then the writ of certiorari may be available, notwithstanding that it has been `taken away’ by statute.”[35]</p>\r\n<p>75.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols sought to distinguish Atterby[36], arguing that there a denial of the right to properly put a case gave rise to the want of procedural fairness considered analogous to a want of jurisdiction in all the circumstances. He contended that s50(2), however, applied in this case where, he argued, there was jurisdiction in the County Court to proceed to a conviction. </p>\r\n<p>76.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols made extensive reference to the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in R v Elliott; ex p Elliott[37]. In Elliott[38] Bray CJ expressed the view that various authorities, including Hedberg v Woodhall[39] and Byrne v Baker[40], related to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed in a case after duplicity had come to light, rather than to the question of the jurisdiction of a court of summary jurisdiction to hear a proceeding commenced by a duplicitous complaint[41]. The Chief Justice held that, although the court may have had jurisdiction to embark upon the enquiry, it may have yet lacked the jurisdiction to make the order ultimately made.[42] </p>\r\n<p>77.&nbsp;Bray CJ relevantly considered the effect of s186(2) of the Justices Act 1921-1972 (SA) which was in similar terms to s50(2), providing:<br />&nbsp;“(2) No judgment, conviction, or order of a court, or other proceeding before justices, shall be quashed or set aside for any mere matter of form or technical error, or mistake in any name, date, or title, or in any matter of description only; but in all cases regard shall be had alone to the substantial merits and justice of the case.” </p>\r\n<p>78.&nbsp;The learned Chief Justice said:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Questions like the present however, are not mere matters of form or technical error within the meaning of sections like s186(2); see: R v North ((1852) 6 Dow, &amp; Ry. K.B. 143), where a conviction in terms of an information bad for duplicity was quashed on certiorari, notwithstanding the provisions of a statute which said that in proceedings of the nature in question no advantage could be taken of a defect of form. Technical in one sense the point undoubtedly is, but it is not a mere matter of technical error, but one which, in my view, goes to the jurisdiction of the court.”[43] </p>\r\n<p>79.&nbsp;S50(2) does not expressly purport to affect the Court’s power to grant relief by way of certiorari, as did s164 of the Justices Act 1957. It also expressly refers to a defect in form in the challenged order, as opposed to the charge. I have already stated my view that the conviction in relation to charge 1 was uncertain as a result of the latent duplicity or ambiguity revealed by the particulars and the evidence. As a result, in my view, Mrs Mansbridge had suffered procedural unfairness or a denial of natural justice and her conviction was liable to be set aside on the basis that the trial was fundamentally flawed, rather than because of any defect in form of the order. Certiorari is available to quash a decision of an inferior court in such a case; see Craig v South Australia[44]. In my view s50(2) does not apply to prevent the conviction in relation to charge 1 being quashed. </p>\r\n<p>Refusal of certiorari in exercise of discretion<br />80.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols argued that, in any event, the Court should refuse certiorari in the exercise of its discretion, because, in his submission, Mrs Mansbridge had either abandoned the points now raised or had acquiesced in the conduct of the proceeding without raising the duplicity argument again at all, or at least until counsel’s written submissions were made to his Honour at the end of the hearing. </p>\r\n<p>81.&nbsp;In Walsh v Tattersall[45] Kirby J stated that it was not the common law that the objection to duplicity could not be taken first on appeal, despite some suggestions by writers to the contrary. </p>\r\n<p>82.&nbsp;The issue of waiver and election was discussed by McInerney J in R v Lilydale Magistrates’ Court[46]. His Honour summarised the authorities canvassed and concluded:<br />&nbsp;<br />“I think the ultimate question is whether on the whole of the facts the applicant is entitled to certiorari and I think this is particularly true where the challenge to the order is based on an allegation of a denial of natural justice. In such a situation the Court might well look to the overall question of the justice of the whole situation.”[47]</p>\r\n<p>83.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols referred to relevant authorities in which certiorari had been refused, which turned on their own facts[48]. He relied upon the decision of Sangster and Jacobs JJ to refuse the writ in Stanton v Abernathy[49]. Both Sangster J[50] and Jacobs J[51] held that certiorari should be withheld in that case because the defendant had acquiesced in the course of the trial, consenting to all charges laid against him being heard together (including the six erroneously included in the duplicitous complaint) and, significantly, because the more appropriate remedy of an appeal was available to correct the error. Bray CJ, however, considered that certiorari should go when an excess or want of jurisdiction appeared on the face of proceedings, notwithstanding the “practical convenience” of the approach of the other members of the court.[52] </p>\r\n<p>84.&nbsp;I am not persuaded that the relief should be refused. I am not satisfied that the point was abandoned, as was argued. Nor, in light of the written submissions made (albeit late in the piece) as to the need for specificity with regard to charge 1, can it be successfully argued that Mrs Mansbridge had waived her rights or elected not to take the point. Further, I take into account that there is no appeal available to Mrs Mansbridge from the decision of his Honour. </p>\r\n<p>The foregone conclusion argument<br />85.&nbsp;Finally, counsel for Mr Nichols submitted that the writ should be refused because it would be futile to quash the conviction as the result of any further hearing would be a foregone conclusion. Suffice it to say that I am not persuaded by this argument. It is possible, in my opinion, that the admissible evidence relevant to any particular offence might not satisfy the court re-hearing the matter that the crime had been committed. </p>\r\n<p>Charge 2<br />86.&nbsp;Charge 2 related to the post-mortem sheep. It was phrased in the words of s9(1)(f) of the Act which created the offence. Accordingly, it complied with the requirements of s27(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act. In my opinion, the words of s9(1)(f) create one offence which might be made out by proof that the owner of a sheep failed to provide it with proper and sufficient food, drink and shelter. The assertion that charge 2 was patently duplicitous was not made out. </p>\r\n<p>87.&nbsp;I am not persuaded by the argument that the reference in the particulars to overstocking gave rise to latent duplicity or ambiguity. In my view, the reference to overstocking rather particularised the failure to provide sufficient food or drink to a confined animal which was otherwise unable to provide those things for itself. It was clear from the findings made by his Honour that he found the offence made out by reason of the observed condition of the sheep and the post-mortem results. Neither the particulars nor the evidence demonstrated any latent duplicity or uncertainty in the charge, in my view, and I am not persuaded that the conviction was affected by duplicity, ambiguity or uncertainty as contended. </p>\r\n<p>Charge 3<br />88.&nbsp;Charge 3 also related to the post-mortem sheep. Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge challenged charge 3 as patently or latently duplicitous. </p>\r\n<p>89.&nbsp;A single offence may be committed by two or more similar acts connected to each other and forming part of the same transaction: see: DPP v Merriman[53]. In my view, the charge, which followed the wording of s9(1)(i) of the Act creating the offence, could be interpreted as describing, as a single act of cruelty to a sick or injured animal, a failure to deal with its condition by providing appropriate treatment or attention, whether that be in the nature of requisite veterinary or other care, either knowingly, negligently or unreasonably. I am not persuaded that it was patently duplicitous. </p>\r\n<p>90.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols made it clear at the outset in the Magistrates’ Court that the reference in paragraph C(iii)(c) of the particulars to charge 3 to the failure to dispose of the animal humanely was not to be pursued. </p>\r\n<p>91.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge nevertheless argued that the charge was latently duplicitous because the particulars referred not only to failure to provide veterinary treatment in the form of lice and worm control, but also to failure to administer appropriate attention. Further, he argued that the particulars failed to specify the alleged mental element, not indicating whether it was alleged that Mrs Mansbridge failed to provide the attention or treatment “knowingly, negligently or unreasonably”. He submitted that the particularised failure to administer veterinary treatment for lice and worm control amounted to one crime and the failure to administer appropriate attention to another. </p>\r\n<p>92.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols responded that the offence was constituted by a composite activity of failing to address the sickness or ailment of the post-mortem sheep. The sickness or ailment was its parasitic burden which should have been treated by veterinary and perhaps other means such as crutching the animal. The ailments included what was reported by Mr Nichols and Dr Rainsford, including the malnourished state of the post-mortem animal. </p>\r\n<p>93.&nbsp;In my view, there was one offence described in s9(1)(i) and it was that of failing to provide the appropriate treatment for the animal. The particulars and the evidence did not reveal a latent duplicity or ambiguity in the charge. Accordingly, the conviction was not uncertain. His Honour accepted the evidence of Dr Rainsford and Mr Nichols as to the condition of the post-mortem sheep. He found that Mrs Mansbridge had been grossly negligent in the care of the sheep, making it clear that he found the criminal standard of negligence to have been established. </p>\r\n<p>Charge 4<br />94.&nbsp;Charge 4 referred to a particular act of cruelty resulting in the death or serious disablement of the post-mortem sheep. The particulars relating to charge 4 combined the particulars of charges 2 and 3, with the addition of a particular of failure to provide acceptable animal husbandry in the form of appropriate fleece harvesting. However, the date on which the alleged act of aggravated cruelty was said to have occurred was given as 11 September 2001, whereas the particulars specified the period of time between 11 August and 11 September 2001 as that relating to charges 2 and 3. Once again, the charge was challenged as being patently and latently duplicitous. </p>\r\n<p>95.&nbsp;The act of cruelty alleged to have resulted in the death or serious disablement was not specified in the charge, the particulars or the reasons. His Honour accepted Dr Rainsford’s evidence, but Dr Rainsford had failed to identify the precise cause of death or disablement of the sheep. She found that the subject sheep were suffering from neglect. His Honour also accepted the evidence of Mr Nichols, but his evidence did nothing to identify the act of aggravated cruelty the subject of the charge and the conviction. His Honour found that Mrs Mansbridge had been grossly negligent in the care of her sheep and that the elements of the aggravated cruelty charges 4 and 7 had been made out. </p>\r\n<p>96.&nbsp;I am persuaded by the submissions of counsel for Mrs Mansbridge that the charge was latently duplicitous or ambiguous and the conviction also therefore uncertain and liable to be quashed. There was in my view a denial of procedural fairness to Mrs Mansbridge by reason of the uncertainty of the conviction and the proceeding was fundamentally flawed. </p>\r\n<p>97.&nbsp;For the reasons given in relation to charge 1, I am not persuaded that the conviction should not be quashed as a result of the operation of s50(2) of the Magistrates’ Court Act. </p>\r\n<p>98.&nbsp;Nor am I persuaded, in all the circumstances, that there was some waiver, acquiescence or election on the part of counsel for Mrs Mansbridge which should result in the remedy of certiorari being refused in the exercise of the Court’s discretion. I note that I have taken into account in this regard the somewhat oblique references to duplicity in relation to charge 4 in the written submissions. No appeal is available and the uncertain conviction should not be allowed to stand. </p>\r\n<p>99.&nbsp;I am further not persuaded that it would be futile to quash the conviction in the sense that it would be a foregone conclusion that Mrs Mansbridge would be convicted of an offence of aggravated cruelty. That will depend upon the elements of the offence with which she is charged and the evidence adduced at any re-hearing. </p>\r\n<p>Charges 5 and 6<br />100.&nbsp;Charges 5 and 6 were in the same terms as charges 2 and 3, respectively, except that they related to the flock comprised of 12 of the 13 dead sheep, the post-mortem sheep having been excluded. The particulars were identical to those provided in relation to charges 2 and 3. </p>\r\n<p>101.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge made the same points in relation to charges 5 and 6 as were made in relation to charges 2 and 3. The arguments are rejected for the same reasons. I am not satisfied that the charges were defective by reason of any duplicity. I am not persuaded that the convictions were uncertain. </p>\r\n<p>Charge 7<br />102.&nbsp;Charge 7 mirrored charge 4 save that it also applied to the dead sheep apart from the post-mortem sheep. Once again the particulars identified 11 September 2001 as the date of the offence whereas the particulars to charges 4 and 5 (which were included as particulars of charge 7) specified the period between 11 August 2001 and 11 September 2001 and 11 August to 2 October 2001, respectively, as the date of those alleged offences. The same challenges were mounted to the charge and to the conviction. I consider that the conviction is uncertain and the proceeding fundamentally flawed for the same reasons as those given in relation to charge 4. </p>\r\n<p>103.&nbsp;For the reasons given in relation to other charges, I am of the view that s50(2) of the Magistrates’ Court Act is also inapplicable. I am not persuaded that certiorari should be refused in the exercise of my discretion because of any alleged waiver or acquiescence or because a conviction on a specific charge of aggravated cruelty relating to the 12 sheep would be a foregone conclusion, rendering the remission of the charge futile. </p>\r\n<p>Failure to give adequate reasons<br />104.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge attacked each of the convictions on the basis that his Honour had failed to give adequate reasons and so had denied procedural fairness to his client. The alleged failure was said in each case to have been so fundamental as to have amounted to a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction of the type identified by the court in Fleet v District Court of NSW &amp; Ors [54]. </p>\r\n<p>Charges 1, 4 and 7<br />105.&nbsp;As I have found that the convictions in relation to charges 1, 4 and 7 should be quashed for uncertainty, it would seem futile to examine the adequacy of the reasons. It might perhaps be arguable that the reasons were adequate to explain the conclusions reached by his Honour, in light of the way in which the case was put to him. However, since I have concluded that the precise crime of which Mrs Mansbridge had been convicted had not been identified, it would appear logically to follow that the reasons were inadequate. </p>\r\n<p>106.&nbsp;I do not propose to consider the challenge to the adequacy of the reasons in relation to those convictions any further. </p>\r\n<p>Charges 2 and 5<br />107.&nbsp;It was submitted in the grounds and orally by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge that the reasons given in relation to the finding that the post-mortem sheep the subject of charge 2 and the rest of the dead sheep the subject of charge 5 were “confined” were inadequate. </p>\r\n<p>108.&nbsp;I am not persuaded by this submission. His Honour found that the sheep were confined, notwithstanding the state of the fence. As counsel for Mr Nichols submitted, the reasons show that his Honour turned his mind to the question whether the sheep were confined taking into account evidence about the state of the fence and concluded that they were. That adequately explains his finding, in my view. </p>\r\n<p>Denial of procedural fairness by admission of evidence relating to duplicitous charges<br />109.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge also argued more generally that she had been denied procedural fairness in relation to any convictions which might otherwise survive his challenges because of the prejudicial effect of evidence given which related to any conviction quashed as duplicitous. I will first consider this submission in relation to the aggravated cruelty charges and then return to charge 1. </p>\r\n<p>110.&nbsp;The conviction of the aggravated cruelty offence, the subject of charge 4, relating to the post-mortem sheep, was successfully challenged. The particulars of the offences the subject of charges 2 and 3 which also related to the post-mortem sheep were combined to form those provided in relation to charge 4, with an added particular of failing to provide acceptable animal husbandry in the form of appropriate fleece harvesting (“a fleece harvesting particular”). The convictions in relation to charges 2 and 3 were not quashed. </p>\r\n<p>111.&nbsp;The conviction of the aggravated cruelty offence, the subject of charge 7, relating to the 12 other sheep, was also successfully challenged. The particulars of charge 7 were an amalgam of those provided of charges 5 and 6 relating to the same 12 sheep with the addition of a fleece harvesting particular. The convictions in relation to charges 5 and 6 survived Mrs Mansbridge’s challenges. </p>\r\n<p>112.&nbsp;A fleece harvesting particular had also been included as a particular of charge 1 which related to the “sticks” or cast sheep. The conviction of the offence the subject of charge 1 was also quashed. The particulars of charge 1 included a reference to a failure to destroy a cast animal in a humane manner. There was no reliance upon such a failure in relation to the charges in respect of the post-mortem sheep or the flock as a whole which included the cast sheep. The remainder of the particulars of charge 1 mirrored those given in respect of all the sheep. </p>\r\n<p>113.&nbsp;The reasons set out his Honour’s summary of the evidence, his findings and resulting conclusions. He relevantly found that:<br />&nbsp;<br />“(9) Many of the sheep in the flock were overburdened with wool, and had not been shorn for at least 14 months or more; (10) The wool burdened sheep had not been crutched, pizzled or wigged; ... (12) The sheep described by Sean Mansbridge in his evidence as the ‘sticks’ sheep was not humanely disposed of [when it should have been] and struggled for a long time before it died.”</p>\r\n<p>114.&nbsp;Dr Rainsford and Mr Nichols gave evidence of their observations of the 13 dead sheep the subject of the convictions in relation to charges 2, 3, 5, and 6. Paragraph 11(c) of the 23 April 2004 Coldham affidavit records that part of the reasons in which his Honour referred to Mr Nichols’ evidence of the inspection of the sheep by him and Dr Rainsford on 11 September 2001 as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Mr Nichols, Dr Rainsford and the police walked to the rear paddock 200-300 metres from the house and Mr Nichols observed a flock of merino sheep with carcasses in the paddock in poor bodily condition, with tattered fleece, lice infestation and long wool, which had not been shorn for over 12 months, that there was no evidence of crutching, pizzling or wigging, that he took photographs, that the pasture was very short, there was a large amount of faeces in the paddock and no evidence of supplementary feeding.”</p>\r\n<p>115.&nbsp;Dr Rainsford’s evidence included her opinion that a break in the wool shown in one of the tendered photographs of one of the sheep had indicated “major stress”. </p>\r\n<p>116.&nbsp;As the surviving convictions relating to charges 3 and 6 under s9(1)(i) of the Act concerned the offences of failing to provide “veterinary or other appropriate attention or treatment” for the 13 “sick or injured” animals, in my view, the evidence of the condition, (including the length) of the fleeces, the failure to shear, crutch, pizzle and wig the sheep in accordance with acceptable standards of animal husbandry may well have been relevant and admissible, in any event. </p>\r\n<p>117.&nbsp;The only other particular which was not provided in relation to any other charge was that of the failure to dispose of the cast animal humanely, given in respect of charge 1. The relevant evidence would include evidence that the sheep was cast, that it had not been shot, that it was dead and that it had not been treated humanely in all the circumstances. In my view, (assuming that a charge in respect of one act of cruelty under s9(1)(c) would have been laid) relevant evidence that the animal the subject of charge 1 was indeed cast and dead would have been given, in any event, because its cast condition distinguished it from the 12 other sheep, the subject of charges 5 and 6. Further, evidence that all the 13 subject sheep had died, without having been shot, would also appear likely to have been adduced to rebut the evidence that he had humanely and appropriately destroyed the sick or injured animals which Mr Sean Mansbridge would presumably have given in the course of Mrs Mansbridge’s defence to charges 3 and 6. </p>\r\n<p>118.&nbsp;I am not persuaded that Mrs Mansbridge was denied procedural fairness by reason of the admission of evidence relevant to the charges giving rise to the quashed convictions. </p>\r\n<p>The operation of s 86<br />119.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge finally argued that if one or more convictions were quashed, all should be quashed because the order of his Honour was not “severable”. He based this submission upon a particular construction of s86 of the Magistrates’ Court Act read in light of the definition of a “sentencing order” in s3(1). </p>\r\n<p>120.&nbsp;The Magistrates’ Court Act relevantly provided:<br />&nbsp;<br />“3 (1) In this Act— <br />''order'' includes judgment and conviction; ... <br />''sentencing order'' means any order made by the Court following a finding of guilt and includes— <br />(a) any order made under Part 3, 3A, 4 or 5 of the Sentencing Act 1991; and <br />(ab) an aggregate sentence of imprisonment imposed in accordance with section 9(1) of the Sentencing Act 1991, or an aggregate fine imposed in accordance with section 51 of that Act, in respect of two or more offences; and <br />(b) the recording of a conviction; ... </p>\r\n<p>83. Appeal to County Court <br />(1) A person may appeal to the County Court against any sentencing order made against that person by the Court in a criminal proceeding conducted in accordance with Schedule 2. ... </p>\r\n<p>85. Appeal operates as re-hearing <br />An appeal under section 83 or 84 must be conducted as a re-hearing and the appellant is not bound by the plea entered in the Magistrates’ Court. </p>\r\n<p>86. Powers of County Court on appeal <br />(1) On the hearing of an appeal under section 83 or&nbsp;84, the County Court— <br />(a) must set aside the order of the Magistrates’ Court; and <br />(b) may make any order which the County Court thinks just and which the Magistrates’ Court made or could have made; and <br />(c) may exercise any power which the Magistrates’ Court exercised or could have exercised.”</p>\r\n<p>121.&nbsp;The notice of the County Court decision exhibited to Mrs Mansbridge’s 3 December 2003 affidavit listed the eight charges under heading “Order/Conviction Appeal Against” and an aggregate fine was included as an item under the heading “Sentence Appealed Against”. Under the heading “Result of Appeal” the convictions and individual fines imposed in relation to charges 1-7 were listed under the introductory words: </p>\r\n<p>“The orders of the Hamilton Magistrates Court on 18/12/2002 and the 3/February/2003 are set aside and in their stead the following orders are made:”</p>\r\n<p>122.&nbsp;Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge relied upon the decision of Ashley J in Rigoli v Minister for Agriculture &amp; Anor [55]in which his Honour stated that “it [was] not doubted that parts of decisions -... of inferior courts ... may be brought up and quashed”. Counsel argued that the construction of s86 for which he contended prevented the severing of any one of the convictions by the County Court. He relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal New South Wales in Parker v DPP[56] in which the court quashed both the challenged imposition of a custodial sentence upon the claimant and the conviction by the District Court on appeal from his conviction and sentence in the Local Court. Kirby P with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed considered the operation of s125 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) which provided relevantly: </p>\r\n<p>“(1) The Court hearing any appeal under this Division shall determine the matter of every such appeal, and may adjourn the hearing thereof, and may by its order, confirm, quash, set aside, vary, increase, or reduce, the conviction, order, sentence, or adjudication appealed against, or make such other order in the matter, as to costs to be paid by either party ... as to the Court seems just... .” </p>\r\n<p>123.&nbsp;The learned President held that the order of the District Court did not differentiate between “a finding of guilt (the conviction) and the imposition of penalty (the sentence)”. His Honour continued:<br />&nbsp;<br />“It is not possible, at least under the legislation operating in this State, for this Court to differentiate between different decisions on the way to the final “order. Thus, it is not possible for this Court to uphold the particular rulings on evidence, procedural directions, the determination of guilt and the sentence differentially...” “ </p>\r\n<p>124.&nbsp;In a decision of the same court handed down shortly after Parker, in Anderson v DPP[57] Kirby P, with whom Meagher and Sheller JJA agreed reached a similar conclusion again based on the construction of s125 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW). In Anderson the challenged order was one for forfeiture made ultra vires by the District Court on an appeal from the Local Court. The court held that it was not possible to sever a conviction and fine related to the offence in respect of which the challenged order had been made. </p>\r\n<p>125.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Nichols argued that s86 of the Magistrates’ Court Act was not in the same terms as s125 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) and it should not be construed so as to include all the convictions and sentences within the meaning of an “order” made by his Honour under s86 upon an appeal from a “sentencing order” as defined in s3(1). </p>\r\n<p>126.&nbsp;Whether or not a number of convictions and sentences the subject of an appeal to the District Court to which s125 of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) related would be regarded as part of one “order” was not the subject of decision in either of Parker or Anderson. The issue in each of those cases related to the severance of parts of what was held to constitute part of an order under s125 in relation to one offence. Suffice it to say that I consider the decisions distinguishable because the issue before me relates to the severability of orders relating to one conviction and sentence from another. </p>\r\n<p>127.&nbsp;S86 provides for the making of any order which is defined as including a conviction in s3(1) on an appeal from a “sentencing order” of the Magistrates’ Court. The “sentencing order” is defined to mean any order following a conviction, including an aggregate sentence of imprisonment or fine imposed in relation to a number of offences, such as that made by the Magistrates’ Court in this case and the subject of the appeal, as well as the recording of a conviction. I am not persuaded that the reference to an order by the County Court on appeal in s 86 should be interpreted as referring to a number of convictions and sentences, as is submitted. Indeed the reference to one aggregate penalty following upon convictions of a number of offences and the absence of a reference to separate convictions and penalties within the definition would seem to militate against such an interpretation on the basis of the maxim: expressio unius est exclusio alterius. The quashing of one conviction should therefore not result in the quashing of every conviction recorded by his Honour at the same time, as argued by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge </p>\r\n<p>The costs order<br />128.&nbsp;The costs order was also attacked on the bases that his Honour had misconceived the extent of his powers and the nature of the function he was to perform. It was argued that the court’s power to make a costs order against Mrs Mansbridge was restricted by the operation of s88AA(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act to the situation in which it had been determined that she had brought the appeal vexatiously, frivolously or in an abuse of process. In making the order in the absence of any such findings, it was submitted that the record disclosed an error of law, that the court had constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction and that his Honour had committed a jurisdictional error. Counsel for Mrs Mansbridge also argued that, if the Court were to quash the convictions, the costs orders could not be severed and would also fall. </p>\r\n<p>S88AA <br />129.&nbsp;I am not persuaded by the argument that his Honour lacked the jurisdiction to make an award of costs after the unsuccessful appeal as a result of the operation of s88AA(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act because s88A(2) would appear to expressly reserve to the court the power under s131 of the same act, as well as its power to order costs under the County Court Act 1958. </p>\r\n<p>130.&nbsp;In Lovejoy v Johnson; Lovejoy v Gainger[58] Coldrey J considered the ambit of the statutory power to award costs under s131 of the Magistrates’ Court Act:<br />&nbsp;<br />“It is clear that there are no Rules of Court governing the award of costs in criminal proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court, and, as I have said, s31 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 confers the widest discretion on the Court in relation to, awarding costs and fixing their amount. In fixing costs a Magistrate may have regard to scales of costs relevant in civil proceedings but is certainly not bound or limited by them. As the authorities indicate, the governing principle to be applied is one of reasonableness.”</p>\r\n<p>131.&nbsp;It was acknowledged in submissions by counsel for Mr Nichols to his Honour that any costs order should not punish Mrs Mansbridge, but counsel urged the court to apply County Court civil scale “D”, on the basis that there had been agreement as to the appropriateness of such an order in favour of Mr Mansbridge at the end of the proceedings in the Magistrates’ Court against him. It was submitted inter alia by counsel for Mrs Mansbridge that the court had no jurisdiction to impose costs calculated on the County Court scale for the Magistrates’ Court proceedings and that, in any event, the lowest scale was the appropriate one to be applied. </p>\r\n<p>132.&nbsp;His Honour acknowledged that costs caused him some anguish. He said in effect that that an award of costs caused financial pain and described the total amount sought as a “huge sum”. His Honour compared the total amount of fines payable with the amount of costs sought and referred to “[t]he sad circumstances at the time of the inspection,” also mentioning Mrs Mansbridge’s health problems at the time. He acknowledged that costs were discretionary and went on to fix the amount at $55,000 having, according to Mrs Mansbridge’s 3 December 2002 affidavit, “taxed off” $30,000. </p>\r\n<p>133.&nbsp;In Sobh v Children’s Court of Victoria and Ors[59] Mandie J held that a magistrate fixing the amount of costs after submission relating to individual items had failed to comply with an obligation to give adequate reasons for the exercise of his discretion when failing to explain his decisions in related to disputed items. Accordingly, it was not possible to conclude whether the decision was open to the magistrate, as a result of the deficiencies in the reasons. </p>\r\n<p>134.&nbsp;In Perkins, citing Penfold v Penfold[60], Buchanan JA stated that reasons might not be required in the case of a court’s decision to award costs against a party[61]. Nevertheless, in my view, in this case the reasons given are inadequate in all the circumstances. The reasons fail to explain:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) the basis for the decision to award costs on the County Court civil scale in relation to the Magistrates’ Court hearing; <br />(b) the basis for the choice of scale “D”, being the highest scale; <br />(c) the items included in the calculation of the amount, apart from reference to an amount calculated by agreement between the representatives of Mr Mansbridge and Mr Nichols; or <br />(d) the basis for the decision to reduce a total amount of $85,829, calculated on scale “D”, by the amount $30,000.</p>\r\n<p>135.&nbsp;It is not possible to discern how his Honour took into account the submissions made by either barrister. It is not possible to determine whether there was an element of punishment involved in the award or whether the order was reasonable in all the circumstances. As a result it is not possible, in my view, to determine whether his Honour erred in fixing the amount awarded against Mrs Mansbridge. The order should be quashed and the issue of the costs of the Magistrates’ Court and County Court proceedings remitted to the County Court for determination according to law. </p>\r\n<p>Orders <br />136.&nbsp;I propose to make orders quashing the convictions relating to charges 1, 4 and 7 and the costs order and remitting those charges for hearing and determination in accordance with law in the County Court. I will hear counsel in relation to the form of the appropriate orders and in relation to costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] (1984) 157 CLR 523. <br />[2] (2000) 2 VR 246. <br />[3] (2000) 2 VR 246 at 270; see Alcoa of Australia Ltd v McKenna [2003] VSCA 182 at [22]. <br />[4] (2000) 2 VR 246 at 273-4. <br />[5] (1987) 10 NSWLR 247. <br />[6] [1999] NSWCA 363. <br />[7] (2003) 139 A Crim R 475. <br />[8] (1972) 2 SASR 529 at 552. <br />[9] [2002] VSCA 98 at [40]. <br />[10] (1937) 59 CLR 467. <br />[11] (1924) SASR at p 340). <br />[12] (1924) SASR 326 at 488-90. <br />[13] (1990) 19 NSWLR 656. <br />[14] (1990) 19 NSWLR at 666. <br />[15] [1972] VR 349 at 400 per Winneke CJ, Little and Barber JJ. <br />[16] (1987) 163 CLR 508 <br />[17] (1990) 19 NSWLR 656. <br />[18] (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 667 <br />[19] (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 667-8 <br />[20] (1937) 59 CLR 467. <br />[21] (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 671 <br />[22] (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 112. <br />[23] (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 112. <br />[24] 89 ALR 321 at 330 per Dawson J; 333 per Toohey J and 337 per Gaudron and McHugh JJ. <br />[25] (1982) 7 A Crim R 8. <br />[26] (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 84 per Dawson and Toohey JJ and at 102 per Kirby J. <br />[27] see Coal Miners’ Industrial Union of Workers of Western Australia v Amalgamated Collieries of Western Australia Ltd (1960) 104 CLR 437 at 454 per Menzies J. <br />[28] [1964] VR 443. <br />[29] [1988] VR 411. <br />[30] [1964] VR 443. <br />[31] Hargreaves v Alderson [1963] 2 WLR 31 and Mallon v Allon [1963] 2 WLR 1053. <br />[32] [1959] VR 800. <br />[33] (1874) LR 5 PC 417. <br />[34] [1959] VR 800. <br />[35] [1959] VR 800 at 809. <br />[36] [1959] VR 800. <br />[37] 8 SASR (1974) 329. <br />[38] 8 SASR (1974) 329. <br />[39] (1913) 15 CLR 531. <br />[40] [1964] VR 443. <br />[41] 8 SASR [1974] 329 at 338. <br />[42] 8 SASR (1974) 329 at 341. <br />[43] 8 SASR [1974] 329 at 341. <br />[44] (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 175-6 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. <br />[45] (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 109-10. <br />[46] [1973] VR 122 <br />[47] [1973] VR 122 at 135 <br />[48] See eg The King v Williams &amp; Ors [1914] 1 KB 608 and R v Magistrates’ Court at Lilydale; ex parte Ciccone [1973] VR 122. <br />[49] (1990) 19 NSWLR 656. <br />[50] 8 SASR [1974] 329 at 367-8. <br />[51] 8 SASR [1974] 329 at 375. <br />[52] 8 SASR [1974] 329 at 342. <br />[53] [1973] AC 584 at 607. <br />[54] [1999] NSWCA 363 at [50]. <br />[55] (Unreported) Supreme Court of Victoria, 10 December 1997 <br />[56] (1992) 65 A Crim R 209 <br />[57] (1992) A Crim R 277 <br />[58] (Unreported) Supreme Court of Victoria no 5819 of 1997 and no 5818 of 1997 <br />[59] (1994) 74 A Crim R 453 <br />[60] (1980) 144 CLR 311. <br />[61] (2000) 2 VR 246 at 272.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the plaintiff Mansbridge: Mr S Gillespie-Jones, counsel.

Some time later the police informant served a copy of the charge and summons and a copy of the brief of evidence on H. A date of hearing was fixed and when the case was called, H. did not appear. The magistrate granted an application for the matter to proceed ex parte. The informant gave evidence and a certificate of analysis was tendered. However, the procedure set out in cl 5 of Schedule 2 of the <em>Magistrates Court Act </em>1989 was not followed. This procedure required the brief of evidence to be tendered in evidence and the magistrate to consider the question of admissibility of any documents in the brief. Further, the informant failed to prove (a) that the PBT was conducted pursuant to s53(1) of the Act (b) that the PBT was conducted on a prescribed device and (c) that the person who operated the breath analysing instrument was authorised to do so by the Chief Commissioner of Police. The defendant was convicted. Upon appeal—<br /><br /><strong>HELD: Appeal allowed. Orders quashed and the charge dismissed.<br />The Court did not follow the proper procedure after a direction was given that the matter proceed ex parte, and further, that the oral evidence called was deficient and failed to prove the case against the appellant. The evidence failed to prove that the operator was authorised to operate the breath analysing instrument and that the instrument was one within the meaning of the Act. Further, there was no proof that the preliminary breath test had been conducted using a device prescribed under the Act. As the evidence before the Court did not establish beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements of proof that rested upon the respondent as informant the magistrate was in error in convicting and penalising N.<br /><br />GILLARD J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;This is an appeal from orders made by the Magistrates’ Court sitting at Broadmeadows pursuant to s92 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 ("Court Act"). The appellant was convicted of an offence against s49(1)(f) of the Road Safety Act 1986 ("the Act"), namely, that being a driver of a motor vehicle, he furnished a sample of his breath for analysis and, upon analysis, the result showed that he had an excess concentration of alcohol in his breath. He was fined $550, his licence to drive a motor vehicle was cancelled and he was disqualified for a period of 10 months from driving in this State.<br /><strong>Parties <br />2.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant, Aaron Hannon ("the appellant"), is aged 35 years, and according to what he told the police, his occupation at the time of the offence was business analyst.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The respondent, Senior Constable Jeremy Norman ("the respondent"), is a member of the Victoria Police and was the informant in the proceeding brought against the appellant.<br /><strong>Proceeding in Magistrates’ Court <br />4.</strong>&nbsp;On 14 December 2004, the appellant was charged with two drink driving offences. On 25 May 2005, a summons was issued by the Broadmeadows Magistrates’ Court. The return date was 6 July 2005. Charge 1 was withdrawn at the hearing. The second charge, of which he was convicted, was expressed as follows:<br />"The defendant at Flemington on 02/09/04 did within three hours after driving a motor vehicle furnish a sample of breath for analysis by a breath analysing instrument pursuant to s55 of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986 and the result of the analysis recorded or shown by the breath analysing instrument indicated that more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol being .05 grams per 210 litres of exhaled air was present in his breath and the concentration of alcohol indicated by the analysis to be present in his breath was not due solely to the consumption of liquor after driving or being in charge of the motor vehicle."<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;The alleged reading was 0.109%, that is, 0.109 grams of alcohol in 210 litres of breath. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;On 15 June 2005, the informant served the appellant, by prepaid post, with the charges and summons and a copy of the brief of evidence. The brief of evidence was served pursuant to s37 of the Court Act. The informant filed with the Magistrates’ Court a copy of the brief of evidence. The return date of the summons was 6 July 2005. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;On 1 July 2005, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent. In it, the appellant stated that he wanted to adjourn the case to August so that he could obtain some advice, as he wished to challenge the breath test result. He asserted that he had drunk two wines and one mixed drink over four hours prior to being intercepted by police. He then stated:<br />"I believe the breath test machine was faulty or else Senior Constable Wansleeben must have made a mistake when operating the machine or he failed to follow proper breath test procedures and this caused the high reading. He will need to be at the court hearing because I want him to tell the Magistrate about the way he used the machine. If there is any way I can keep my licence without having to fight this in court, I would be happy to take that option."<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;On the same day, he forwarded a letter to the Court seeking an adjournment "for about four weeks" in order to obtain advice. He attached a copy of the letter to the respondent. By reason of s58(2) of the Act, an accused person may give notice in writing to an informant that he requires the person who gave the breathalyser certificate to attend court. The giving of the notice has an effect upon the evidentiary weight of the certificate after it is tendered in evidence. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;It appears that the matter was adjourned to 3 October 2005 for a contested hearing. On that day, the appellant did not appear to contest the charges. He was convicted and penalised in his absence. He did not seek to have the matter re-heard by the Magistrates’ Court pursuant to s93 of the Court Act. If he had, and his application had been granted, it would have been necessary for the charges to be re-heard de novo. If he had proceeded down that path, he would have had to state in his application form for a re-hearing why he did not attend the original hearing. See s94(1)(a) of the Court Act. The lodging of the notice would not have stayed the order cancelling his licence (see s93(3)), but he could have applied for a stay pursuant to s94(4). This procedure obviously did not suit the appellant’s purpose. Instead, he filed a Notice of Appeal to the County Court on 5 October 2005 and was granted permission to drive, pending appeal, by a magistrate on 7 October 2005. The County Court appeal was fixed for hearing on 24 January 2006. The appeal in the County Court would have been a re-hearing <em>de novo</em>. This would have given the appellant the opportunity to contest the charges, including, of course, any factual matter, and the opportunity to call evidence. He declined to do this because on the last day permitted by s92 of the Court Act, he appealed to this Court. On 2 November 2005, the appellant filed his Notice of Appeal in this Court. On 10 November 2005, the appellant swore an affidavit in support of his appeal and on 21 November 2005, at a directions hearing held by Master Efthim, the latter granted a stay of the Magistrates’ Court’s orders until further order. On 24 January 2006, the County Court appeal was struck out. There is no evidence before this Court as to the reason why the appellant did not attend the hearing in the Magistrates’ Court. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The steps taken by the appellant have resulted in deferring the finalisation of the charges brought against him by a period of nearly one year. The lodging of a County Court appeal does not constitute an election by the appellant to waive any other appeal rights. See s83(2) of the Court Act. The steps taken by him were in accordance with the law. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;The charges were heard and determined in the Magistrates’ Court in the absence of the appellant. The hearing was recorded and a transcript has been prepared by the appellant and placed before the Court on the appeal.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;On 21 November 2005, Master Efthim ordered that any affidavit by the respondent be filed on or before 12 December 2005. An affidavit of the respondent, sworn 2 June 2006, was filed with the Court on 5 June 2006. It was received by counsel for the appellant some days before that. Mr SP Hardy of counsel, who appeared for the appellant, objected to the Court considering it on the appeal as it was late and contained irrelevant matter. He disavowed any prejudice. The affidavit sets out in chronological form the steps that were taken by the appellant. I granted leave to the respondent to file and serve the affidavit out of time, subject to the objection of relevance. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;It is necessary to set out what took place before the magistrate. The transcript revealed what occurred as follows: <br />"The case of Aaron Hannon was called to Court 2 by the Clerk.<br />1.&nbsp;Prosecutor:&nbsp;Good morning Your Honour.<br />2.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Good morning.<br />3.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Your Honour, I just had this mentioned, it was booked in for a contest today. I have just been given a list, and there are other people waiting, I have two police witnesses waiting. At this stage Mr Hannon has not presented himself and it would be an application for an ex parte. <br />4.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Alright. We’ll just have him pages (sic) one more time.<br />5.&nbsp;Clerk:&nbsp;Aaron Hannnon to court room two. Aaron Hannon.<br />6.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;In fact there has been a brief of evidence serviced, is that right? <br />7.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;There has Your Honour. That’s right. That was the initial course of action.<br />8.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;I grant your application to proceed ex parte.<br />9.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Thank you Your Honour. I officially tender the Road Safety (General) Regulation 1999. Call the informant constable ...<br />10.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Yes. Are you proceeding on both charges?<br />11.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;No, Your Honour, we will strike out one and proceed on two.<br />12.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;I withdraw charge 1. The 49(1)(b).<br />13.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;I think it is struck out as opposed to withdrawn Your Honour.<br />14.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;I’ll hear the evidence and then if I am satisfied I will strike it out before ... Right. Yes, take the witness box please sir.<br />15.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;[Sworn in]<br />16.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;My full name is Jeremy .... I am a senior constable of police stationed at Brunswick Police Station.<br />17.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Will a summary suffice your worship?<br />18.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;On Wednesday 1 September 2004 at approximately 11.48PM the defendant was driving a black Mazda wagon registration number SIG 785 in a southerly direction along Stubbs Road (sic) in Flemington where he was intercepted at a breath testing station which was set up and operating pursuant to the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986. A preliminary breath test was conducted on the driver the result of which indicted (sic) the defendant’s breath contained alcohol. The defendant then accompanied police to the breath testing vehicle for the purpose of undergoing a breath analysis test. The defendant furnished a sample of breath for analysis on the breath analysing instrument. The result of the analysis showed that the defendant has a breath alcohol concentration of 0.109%. the defendant admitted to drinking 2 glasses of wine and one mixed spirit. The defendant’s reason for exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol was "I don’t know if I should answer". <br />19.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Do you have the certificate of analysis with you?<br />20.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;I do.<br />21.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;And did you make any inquiries with VicRoads as to the status of the defendant’s licence?<br />22.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;I did. I applied for an extract from VicRoads.<br />23.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Do you have a copy of that with you?<br />24.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;I don’t.<br />25.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Can you explain to her Honour what that is?<br />26.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;A certified extract from VicRoads, stating that Mr Aaron Hannon was licenced (sic) under the <em>Road Safety Act </em>and his licence was current at the date of the offence.<br />27.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;I tender that Your Honour. Now, how was Mr Hannon dealt with on the night?<br />28.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;He was given a penalty notice which - <br />29.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;I don’t remember the monetary penalty but it was disqualified and cancelled for 10 months.<br />30.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;And you weren’t the authorized operator of the breathalyser. There was another office there?<br />31.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;Yes, that’s correct Your Honour.<br />32.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;That’s the evidence of this witness Your Honour.<br />33.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Can you give me the full name and address of the driver.<br />34.&nbsp;Norman:&nbsp;Aaron Hannon. 27 White Street Footscray. Date of Birth was 23 of 12 1970.<br />35.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Are you calling any other evidence?<br />36.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;No Your ...<br />37.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Is there any evidence at all of the certification of the operator? You need to establish that` don’t you?<br />38.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;With the tendering of the certificate that becomes conclusive proof that it - <br />39.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Oh it does to. Unless there is evidence to the contrary ...<br />40.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;it was operated – Yes.<br />41.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Yes, I find the charge proved. Any matters being alleged?<br />42.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;No Your Honour.<br />43.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Charge 1 is the normal alternative charge isn’t it?<br />44.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;Yes, to be struck out. We will be proceeding on 2. Thank you Your Honour.<br />45&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;Any matters being alleged?<br />46.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;No Your Honour.<br />47.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;There are three charges. There should only be two aren’t there.<br />48.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;There should be. Excuse me, my apologies. The third one is – assuming this went ahead as a contest, the original 49(1)(b) was to be struck out. The third charge is a correct replacement for that charge. So if charge one could be withdrawn. That charge is incorrect. If charge three, which is the alternate one could be struck out. And proceed on two please.<br />49.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;OK. What was the infringement amount?<br />50.&nbsp;PROS:&nbsp;$429.00 Your Honour.<br />51.&nbsp;MAG:&nbsp;The defendant’s licence is cancelled for a period of 10 months effective from the 3rd October 2005. He is convicted and fined $550.00 with costs of $36.80."<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The breathalyser operator was present in Court but was not called as a witness. Mr Hardy submits that the evidence placed before the magistrate failed to establish each element of the charge against his client, and that the magistrate should have dismissed the charge. As the appellant did not appear at the hearing, it was open to the prosecution to proceed, in accordance with the provisions of the Court Act, as an <em>ex parte </em>matter. Upon application by the prosecutor, the magistrate granted the application to proceed ex parte pursuant to s41(2)(b) of the Court Act.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;A number of matters are noted:<br />• The appellant did not attend at Court despite giving a notice requiring the presence in Court of the breath analyser operator; <br />• The magistrate and the prosecutor were aware that a brief of evidence had been served;<br />• The magistrate granted the application of the prosecutor to proceed <em>ex parte</em> pursuant to s41(2)(b) of the Court Act; <br />• The prosecutor did not tender the brief of evidence which had been served on the appellant and filed with the Court;<br />• The prosecutor called the informant as a witness;<br />• The magistrate agreed with that course;<br />• The prosecutor requested an indication from the magistrate as to whether a summary of the offence would suffice. There was apparently no response to that request, although it may be inferred the magistrate agreed;<br />• The informant gave a summary of the offence;<br />• The Certificate of Analysis was apparently tendered; <br />• It was noted by the magistrate that the informant was not the authorised operator of the breathalyser. The informant informed the Court that there was another officer present in Court;<br />• The magistrate adverted to calling further evidence and posed the question of whether there was any evidence of the certification of the operator. The prosecutor stated that the tendering of the certificate became conclusive proof; and<br />• The magistrate observed that that was so, unless there was evidence to the contrary.<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;It is necessary to now consider the procedure available in the Magistrates’ Court where a criminal proceeding proceeds <em>ex parte</em>. <br /><strong><em>Ex parte </em>procedure in summary offence <br />17.</strong>&nbsp;The 1989 Court Act contained a new procedure relating to ex parte hearings in criminal cases. The object was to shorten the hearing time involved in cases where a defendant did not appear in answer to a summons charging him with a summary criminal offence. There was power to proceed ex parte under the pre-existing Act. There was also an alternative procedure available, which involved the informant serving a sworn statement on the defendant and the defendant having an election to appear. See s78(3)(a) and ss84-89 of the <em>Magistrates (Summary Proceedings) Act </em>1975. The new procedure under the 1989 Act was a variation on the previous legislation, but was markedly different. Section 37 authorises an informant to serve on a defendant charged with a summary offence, a brief of evidence. Section 37(1) specifies what must be contained in the brief of evidence. First, a notice in the prescribed form explaining s37 and clause 5 of schedule 2. Secondly, a list of the persons who have made statements which the informant intends to tender at the hearing, if the defendant does not appear, and thirdly, copies of the statements. In addition, the brief of evidence must contain a copy of the charge sheet relating to the offence, together with any other documents which the informant intends to rely upon, a list of proposed exhibits and a photograph of any proposed exhibit that cannot be described in detail on the list. Section 37(2) prescribes the means of ensuring that the statements are true and correct. A statement must either be in the form of an affidavit or contain an acknowledgment that the statement is true and correct and made in the belief that if a false statement is made the person shall be liable to perjury. If the maker of a statement is under the age of 18 years, that fact must be stated. Sections 37(3) and 37(4) deal with a situation where the maker of a statement cannot read. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;A brief of evidence must be served either by personal service or by leaving the brief at the defendant’s last and most usual place of residence or of business, or, in respect to certain offences, by prepaid post to residence or business. See ss34 and 36(1). I interpolate to note that there is an alternative procedure under s37A that permits the service of an outline of evidence on the defendant, which may be relied upon if the defendant fails to appear at the proceeding. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;Section 41 deals with the non-appearance by the defendant. If a defendant fails to appear, the Court may, <em>inter alia</em>, proceed to hear and determine the charge in his or her absence in accordance with Schedule 2 to the Act. The Schedule prescribes, <em>inter alia</em>, the procedure of a summary criminal hearing. Clause 5 of Schedule 2 deals with the situation where the defendant does not appear after the informant has served a brief of evidence. The first step is for the Court to direct that the matter proceed in the absence of the defendant. See s41(2). The next step is for the magistrate to determine whether the informant has served the brief of evidence on the defendant in accordance with s37. Once the magistrate is so satisfied, any statements served in the brief of evidence, and any admissible exhibits or documents referred to therein, are admissible "as if their contents were a record of evidence given orally." See clause 5(1)(c) and (d). The Court is empowered to rule as inadmissible the whole or part of any statement or of any exhibit or document referred to in the brief. See clause 5(2).<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;The prosecutor sought and obtained a direction that the hearing and determination of the charge proceed ex parte. However, the procedure set out in clause 5 of Schedule 2 was not followed. Although it was known to both the magistrate and the prosecutor that a brief of evidence had been served, the prosecutor did not make any reference to any document in the brief, nor did the prosecutor seek to tender the contents of the brief. It followed that the Court was not called upon to rule as to the admissibility of any document contained in the brief. Nothing was said at the hearing to lead to the conclusion that the magistrate was relying upon any document in the brief, nor does it appear that the prosecutor sought to rely upon any document in the brief. In my opinion, if the procedure under clause 5 of Schedule 2 is to be followed, the brief of evidence must be tendered in evidence. To avoid any doubts about what was tendered, the documents should be marked as Exhibits. Further, the magistrate must consider the question of admissibility of any of the documents in the brief. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;The fact that the defendant did not appear does not entitle the prosecution to obtain a conviction without proper proof of the elements of the charge. Whilst the objection to the tendering of inadmissible evidence may be waived by a litigant present at a hearing, the mere absence of the litigant does not entitle the Court to ignore the principles of evidence. Where a proceeding is heard ex parte, it is incumbent upon the Court to closely examine the evidence to ensure that it is admissible. It would appear that neither the magistrate nor the prosecutor fully understood the requirements of the Act and the Schedule with respect to an <em>ex parte </em>hearing, where a brief of evidence had been served pursuant to s37. Although the magistrate directed that the matter could proceed <em>ex parte</em>, at the request of the prosecutor and presumably pursuant to s41(2)(b), the procedure laid down by clause 5 of Schedule 2 was ignored. Further, despite the direction, the prosecutor called oral evidence relating to the charge. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Chris Ryan SC, on behalf of the respondent, submitted that although the Court had directed that the matter should proceed ex parte, the charge was not heard and determined in accordance with clause 5 of Schedule 2, the jurisdiction was accordingly not properly exercised, and the matter should be remitted to the Magistrates’ Court to be re-heard. Mr Hardy, on behalf of the appellant, opposed this course, and submitted that on the evidence placed before the magistrate, the informant had failed to prove the charge, and accordingly the appeal should be allowed and the charge dismissed. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;This Court on an appeal, after determining the same, has the power to remit the case for rehearing to the Magistrates’ Court.[1] A factor which is relevant to the exercise of that power in the present matter is the effect in law of what the magistrate did. The thrust of Mr Ryan’s submission was that the jurisdiction had not been exercised and accordingly, the proceeding was a nullity. Before considering any such question, it is necessary to hear and determine the appeal before the Court. At the outset, it is necessary to state a number of concessions made on behalf of the respondent.<br /><strong>Concessions by Respondent <br />24.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Ryan, on behalf of the respondent, conceded that the hearing conducted by the magistrate was not in accordance with the law. He submitted that once the magistrate had granted leave to proceed ex parte, the proceeding should have been conducted pursuant to clause 5 of Schedule 2. The Court did not properly exercise its jurisdiction. Further, he conceded that on the evidence before the magistrate, the informant failed to prove the case in a number of respects. He accepted that it was essential in proving the offence prescribed by s49(1)(f) of the Act that the preliminary breath test was performed in accordance with the Act. The authorities establish that an informant must prove that the preliminary breath test was conducted pursuant to s53(1). See <em>Smith v Van Maanen</em>;[2] <em>DPP v Webb</em>;[3] <em>DPP v Foster</em>;[4] and <em>DPP Reference No. 2 of (2001)</em>.[5] <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;I must say that I have difficulty with the proposition that it is an essential element of the proof of a breach of s49(1)(f) that a preliminary breath test has been undergone. Section 49(1)(f) establishes that certain conduct is an offence. It is a statutory offence. The elements which constitute the offence are established by the provision. There is no common law rule that a prosecution must prove that the evidence was lawfully obtained. Of course, it would be open to a defendant to raise such an issue. Whether or not the evidence would be excluded would be a matter for the Court. The mere fact that there are a number of provisions in the Act which deal with the right to demand a preliminary breath test, does not appear to me to be a basis for inferring that the Legislature intended that it was an essential element of proof of an offence under s49(1)(f) that a preliminary breath test had been undertaken in accordance with the law. However, it is clear that the authorities establish the proposition and they bind both this Court and the Magistrates’ Court. <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;In this case, there was oral evidence that a preliminary breath test had been undertaken, and had established the presence of alcohol on the breath of the appellant. In a recent decision in this Court, Hargrave J held that it was necessary to prove that the preliminary breath test was conducted on a prescribed device.[6] Mr Ryan did not seek to argue to the contrary. He accepted that there was an omission in the oral evidence that the device was a prescribed one, and that this was fatal to the success of the prosecution. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to consider the question decided by Hargrave J that the informant must prove that the preliminary breath test was conducted on a prescribed device. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;The third concession made by Mr Ryan was that on the oral evidence before the magistrate, the informant failed to prove that the person who operated the breath analysing instrument was authorised to do so by the Chief Commissioner of Police. Section 58(2) of the Act is an evidentiary provision which, if complied with, provides evidence of certain matters concerning the breath analysing instrument and its use. The production of the certificate containing the prescribed particulars produced by the instrument is conclusive proof of certain matters, unless the accused person gives notice in writing to the informant. The appellant did so in the present matter. But that is not the end of the certificate. It still has evidentiary value. By reason of s58(2D), a certificate remains admissible in evidence but if notice is given, "in that event, the certificate ceases to be conclusive proof of the facts and matters referred to in that sub-section." As stated, it appears the certificate was tendered in evidence. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Furze v Nixon</em>,[7] the Court of Appeal held[8] that if the certificate is no longer conclusive proof, its contents provide evidence, but only as to the matters contained in the certificate. In the present matter, the certificate did not state that the operator was authorised by the Chief Commissioner of Police. Accordingly, on the evidence before the magistrate, there was no proof of the fact that the operator was authorised to operate the instrument. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;I also have difficulty with the reasoning in <em>Furze v Nixon</em>.[9] The certificate is still admissible in evidence even though notice has been given. Sections 58(2) and 58(2D) make it clear that it is evidence, but no longer conclusive evidence. It is not only evidence of the facts and matters contained in it – see s58(2)(a) – but on a plain reading of the two provisions, is evidence of the other matters set out in s58(2). The difference, however, is that it is not conclusive evidence, which means that it is open to a defendant to challenge the evidence. The certificate is given pursuant to s55(4) of the Act. The certificate must contain prescribed particulars. The prescribed particulars are set out in Regulation 203 of the <em>Road Safety (General) Regulations </em>1999. The prescribed particulars do not include some of the matters set out in s58(2)(b)-(f) (inclusive) of the Act. Despite this, the certificate is conclusive proof of all those matters unless notice is given. All that changes on a notice being given, is that the evidence is no longer conclusive. However, it is still evidence. It is then a matter for the defendant to contest any of the factual matters set out in s58(2). The reasoning in Furze v Nixon seems to me to be inconsistent with the intention of the Legislature. However, <em>Furze v Nixon </em>is a decision which binds this Court and Mr Ryan did not seek to submit that the observations made by the Court of Appeal were obiter dicta or that the reasoning was incorrect. <br /><strong>30</strong>.&nbsp;By reason of the concessions made, it was accepted on behalf of the respondent that the Court had not followed the proper procedure after a direction was given that the matter proceed ex parte, and further, that the oral evidence called was deficient and failed to prove the case against the appellant. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;As stated, it was Mr Ryan’s submission that the orders should be set aside and that the charge be remitted to the Magistrates’ Court so that the proper procedure should be followed and the jurisdiction exercised in accordance with the law. I interpolate to observe that the respondent has not appealed the orders made in the Magistrates’ Court, nor has he sought judicial review. In the circumstances, it was most unlikely that the respondent would have had a right to appeal or standing to bring judicial review. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Hardy countered Mr Ryan’s submission by submitting that the police should ensure that a summary prosecution is properly presented, that all evidence is placed before the Court, and that the charge be proven beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that the oral evidence was defective. <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant has appealed the orders. He has invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. The appeal must be heard and determined. <br /><strong>Points of law and grounds of appeal <br />34.</strong>&nbsp;The Notice of Appeal filed on 2 November 2005 identified three points of law. The first point raised the question of whether the magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant given that notice had been given pursuant to s58(2) of the Act, the operator of the breath analysing instrument had not been called as a witness, and no order was made pursuant to s58(2C). The point was that there was no evidence before the magistrate of the matters set out in s58(2)(a) – (f) (inclusive) of the Act. <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;The second point raised the question of whether the prosecution had failed to prove that the preliminary breath test had been conducted using a device prescribed under s53 of the Act. The third point raised was the question of whether the magistrate erred in law in convicting the appellant when "all of the evidence given by the informant was hearsay". <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;The Notice of Appeal, after stating the questions of law, then proceeded to state what are described as eight grounds of appeal. Save for grounds 7 and 8, they do not constitute grounds of appeal. In the circumstances, it is more convenient to deal with the points of law as to the grounds of appeal. They raise the real issues. <br /><strong>First point of law <br />37.</strong>&nbsp;On the assumption that the only evidence before the Court was the oral evidence given before the magistrate, the ground has clearly been made out. By reason of <em>Furze v Nixon</em>, the certificate produced by the breath analysing instrument did not contain certain matters that must be proven. It was necessary to prove that the operator was authorised to do so by the Chief Commissioner of Police and that the instrument was one within the meaning of the Act. This ground has been established. <br /><strong>Second point of law <br />38.</strong>&nbsp;On the basis that the decision of Hargrave J in <em>Shabbir Sirajuddin v Glenn Ziino</em>,[10] is correct, there was no proof that the preliminary breath test had been conducted using a device prescribed under the Act. This ground has also been established. <br /><strong>Third point of law <br />39.</strong>&nbsp;This point of law has not been made out. The informant’s evidence was not all hearsay. <br /><strong>Conclusion <br />40.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant has established a number of grounds of appeal and is entitled to have the orders set aside. Mr Ryan submitted that the magistrate, having directed that the matter should proceed ex parte pursuant to s41(2) of the Court Act, did not exercise the jurisdiction of the Court as required by s41(2)(b), namely, to proceed in accordance with Schedule 2. There is no doubt that both the magistrate and the prosecutor misunderstood the procedure to follow where a direction is given that the charge be heard and determined ex parte. But the effect of the mistake is not to make the proceeding null and void. At most, it could be voidable, which means that on appeal or judicial review, the orders made could be set aside. What took place did not constitute a want of jurisdiction. The Magistrates’ Court clearly had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge. It made a mistake in its procedure to hear and determine the matter, having directed that it be heard ex parte. Nevertheless, despite that direction, oral evidence was given. The Court exercised its jurisdiction. What it did may arguably be voidable, but is not null and void. Sections 37 and 41 of the Court Act, and Schedule 2, do not relate to the jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Court but are provisions which provide for a certain procedure in relation to the exercise of the jurisdiction. The Court exercised the jurisdiction and what occurred did not make the purported exercise of the jurisdiction void. This is made clear by what Dixon J said in <em>Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte</em>.[11] His Honour said:<br />"It is not true that because an information is in fact laid out of time, the Court of Petty Sessions is powerless to deal with it. Whether or not an information was laid too late is a question committed to their decision; it is not a matter of jurisdiction. In courts possessing the power, by judicial writ, to restrain inferior tribunals from an excess of jurisdiction, there has ever been a tendency to draw within the scope of the remedy provided by the writ complaints that the inferior court has proceeded with some gross disregard of the forms of law or the principles of justice. <u>But this tendency has been checked again and again, and the clear distinction must be maintained between want of jurisdiction and the manner of its exercise. Where there is a disregard of or failure to observe the conditions, whether procedural or otherwise, which attend the exercise of jurisdiction or govern the determination to be made, the judgment or order may be set aside and avoided by proceedings by way of error, certiorari, or appeal.</u> But, if there be want of jurisdiction, then the matter is <em>coram non judice</em>. It is as if there were no judge and the proceedings are as nothing. They are void, not voidable." <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;In that case, the High Court was concerned with the prerogative writ jurisdiction of this Court. The prerogative writ of <em>certiorari </em>was available to quash orders that were voidable.[12] Dixon J made it clear that a voidable order may be set aside on appeal if there was an avenue of appeal. In my opinion, his Honour’s observations are apposite to the effect of what occurred in the Magistrates’ Court when hearing and determining the charge against the appellant. However, the respondent has not sought to appeal the orders made or to seek judicial review of them. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;At best, from the respondent’s position, the proceeding was arguably voidable only and since there is no proceeding in this Court to attack its validity, in my opinion this appeal should be determined in accordance with general principles. The appellant has succeeded. The orders convicting and penalising the appellant must be set aside. The evidence before the Court did not establish beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements of proof that rested upon the respondent as informant. There is no basis for remitting the charge back to the Magistrates’ Court for re-hearing. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;Subject to submissions by counsel, I propose to make the following orders:<br />(i) That the appeal be allowed; <br />(ii) That the orders made by the Magistrates’ Court at Broadmeadows on 3 October 2005, namely, that the appellant be convicted of a breach of s49(1)(f) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986; that he be fined $550 with $36.80 statutory costs; that his licence be cancelled; and that he be disqualified from driving in the State of Victoria for a period of ten months, be set aside; <br />(iii) That the charge be dismissed; <br />(iv) That the respondent pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal, including any reserved costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See s92(7) of the Court Act. <br />[2] (1991) 14 MVR 365 at 371. <br />[3] [1993] 2 VR 403 at 407. <br />[4] [1999] 2 VR 643 at paras 34 and 35. <br />[5] (2001) 4 VR 55 at para 23. <br />[6] See <em>Shabbir SiraJuddin v Glen Ziino </em>[2005] VSC 418.

There is no punctuation or language to suggest that Parliament intended a separation between the two elements of driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle within the last preceding three hours on the one hand, and the vehicle being involved in an accident on the other hand. There is no word or other indication of disjunction. It is one composite statement of that as to which the member of the police force must have a belief on reasonable grounds. The offence under s49(1)(c) of the Act does not require the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the police officer requiring the person to undergo a PBT believed on reasonable grounds that the person drove the motor vehicle when it was involved in an accident. Accordingly, a magistrate was correct in holding that reasonable grounds existed for the police informant to form the belief referred to in s53(1)(c) of the Act. <br /><br />HANSEN J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;This appeal is brought pursuant to 92 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 by the appellant, Brett Sawyer, from a conviction and orders made against him by the Magistrates’ Court at Moe on 9 September 2005. On that day he pleaded not guilty to two charges, namely that at Moe on 29 September 2004:<br />(a) having been required to undergo a preliminary breath test in accordance with s53(1) of the <em>Road Safety Act </em>1986 he refused to undergo such test within three hours of being the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident; <br />(b) he drove a motor vehicle on a highway namely Margaret Street during a period of disqualification from obtaining an authorisation to drive a motor vehicle. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The charge of driving while disqualified was dismissed on the ground that it was not established that the appellant did drive a motor vehicle as alleged. However, on the charge of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test the appellant was convicted and the following orders were made, namely he was disqualified from driving in the State of Victoria for four years, he was placed on a community based order for a period of four months for which purpose he was to attend the Morwell Community Correctional Services by 4.00 pm on 13 September 2005 and perform 60 hours of unpaid community work over four months, and he was ordered to pay costs of $105.60. There was a stay until 7 October 2005. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;By his notice of appeal the appellant identified two questions of law as arising, namely whether the learned Magistrate erred:<br />(a) In convicting the appellant of refusing a preliminary breath test after finding that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that an accident had occurred; <br />(b) In dismissing the charge of driving while disqualified while, on the same facts, convicting the appellant of the charge of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test following an accident.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;At the outset of the hearing counsel for the appellant abandoned the second question of law. The appeal concerns only the correctness in law of the conviction on the charge of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test. No question is raised as to the correctness of the decision on the charge of driving while disqualified. The second question of law was simply inapposite. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;That leaves as the sole question raised on the appeal whether it was open to the learned Magistrate to find the charge of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test proved in the circumstance that he found, on the charge of driving while disqualified, that it was not established that an accident had occurred. To understand how the point is put it is necessary to refer to the relevant legislation, the facts and the reasoning of the learned Magistrate. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The offence of refusing a preliminary breath test is contained in s49(1)(c) which provides that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she refuses to undergo a preliminary breath test in accordance with s53 when required under that section to do so. Section 53, which I set out in full in view of the argument, provides as follows:<br />"53. Preliminary breath tests<br />(1) A member of the police force may at any time require—<br />(a) any person he or she finds driving a motor vehicle or in charge of a motor vehicle; or<br />(b) the driver of a motor vehicle that has been required to stop, and remain stopped at a preliminary testing station under section 54(3); or<br />(c) any person who he or she believes on reasonable grounds has within the last 3 preceding hours driven or been in charge of a motor vehicle when it was involved in an accident; or<br />(d) any person who he or she believes on reasonable grounds was, within the last 3 preceding hours, an occupant of a motor vehicle when it was involved in an accident, if it has not been established to the satisfaction of the member of the police force which of the occupants was driving or in charge of the motor vehicle when it was involved in the accident-<br />to undergo a preliminary breath test by a prescribed device.<br />(2) An officer of the Corporation or of the Department of Infrastructure who is authorised in writing by the Corporation or the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, as the case requires, for the purposes of this section may at any time require any person he or she finds driving a commercial motor vehicle or in charge of a commercial motor vehicle to undergo a preliminary breath test by a prescribed device.<br />(3) A person required to undergo a preliminary breath test must do so by exhaling continuously into the device to the satisfaction of the member of the police force or the officer of the Corporation or of the Department of Infrastructure. <br />(4) A person is not obliged to undergo a preliminary breath test if more than 3 hours have passed since the person last drove, was an occupant of or was in charge of a motor vehicle."<br />In this section the expression "motor vehicle" includes a motor cycle; see the definitions in s3. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;I now refer to the evidence that was before the learned Magistrate. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The first person to give evidence for the prosecution was Joanne Michelle Hicks. On 29 September 2004 at about 4.30 pm she came home from work, parked her car in the front yard, checked mail in the letter box and as she turned to go to her house heard a motor bike "revving up really loud and then all of a sudden it stopped revving and I noticed that the motor bike had fallen over". It was about 30 metres from King Street, in Margaret Street. Referring again to what she saw, the motor bike had fallen over "and I saw the guy, he was ... laying down with the bike ah it looked as though the bike was on the right hand side of the road. I’ve gone in to call an ambulance". By the time she went outside to have a look the motor bike had disappeared. It looked as though it was a green Kawasaki motor bike. She said that there was also "a lady out there ... near the bike after it had fallen over". Ms Hicks did not know the rider of the motor bike. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;In cross-examination Ms Hicks said that she did not hear a crash or a skid, she heard revving and it stopped. She did not see the motor bike approach. She just saw it on its side. She did not see it moving. She did not see any smashed item. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The next witness was the informant Senior Constable Veronika Forai, the respondent to the appeal. On 29 September 2004 she was on mobile patrol duty with Senior Constable Hatswell when at approximately 4.37 pm they received information from Police Communications to attend at the intersection of King and Margaret Streets, Moe as a result of a motor cycle collision at that location. They duly attended at the location. There was no sign of a motor bike. There were however "scrap" marks on the road and at the location she had a conversation with a person she now knew to be Rose Saunders. Rose told her that her ex-lover Brett Sawyer was involved in the motor cycle collision, and she handed Senior Constable Forai a dark coloured wallet which she said fell out of his pocket at the time. Senior Constable Forai said that she looked inside the wallet which contained personal cards and a birth extract belonging to Brett Sawyer. As a result of the conversation with Rose Saunders and the information gained from the wallet she believed that the rider of the motor cycle at the time it was involved in a collision was Brett Sawyer. She then went to 60 King Street which was diagonally across from the collision scene. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;I interpolate that in my view the word "scrap" in reference to marks on the road should be read as "scrape". That accords with later evidence. The error has occurred in a typing up of the tape recording of the hearing. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Senior Constable Forai and Senior Constable Hatswell knocked on the front door of the premises but, not being answered and hearing voices from the rear of the property, walked to the side gate where a male gave them access. Senior Constable Forai said that she approached a male who identified himself as Brett Sawyer. She observed blood on his left arm and fingers. She said to him that he had been observed riding his motor bike on King and Margaret Streets and to have had an accident. He replied that he did not know what she was talking about and asked "do you see a bike here?". He was becoming "sort of agitated and angry, there was also a female who was yelling and screaming in the background in the back yard of the premises". She asked how he injured his hand and he said there was nothing wrong with it. She said that "there is an ambulance here to treat you" and he said he did not need an ambulance, "Im just having a drink". Senior Constable Forai then said to him that she believed on reasonable grounds that he was the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident within the last three hours and required him to undergo a preliminary breath test on a prescribed device to her satisfaction. He refused. He was warned of the penalty if he refused and was found guilty to which he said "it’s 4 years, I know it’s my second time". Senior Constable Forai again required him to undergo a preliminary breath test and again he refused. When asked for a reason for doing so he said that he was having a quiet barbecue. Finally, Senior Constable Forai said that she attended at Sawyer’s premises at 4.45 pm.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;In cross-examination Senior Constable Forai said that she saw a scrape on the road. She did not know if it was there before. She did not see any plastic, smashed glass, oil or anything. In reference to the blood on Sawyer’s hand, it looked like blood, she did not believe it was juice from meat but could not say definitely it was human blood. It could have been blood from meat or anything. She did not see an injury, and did not find the motor cycle. She had no evidence of damage to the motor cycle or that there was an injury to his arm. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The final witness for the prosecution was Senior Constable John Edward Hatswell. He confirmed being on mobile duty and following a call about a motor vehicle accident attending at the intersection of King and Margaret Streets, Moe. A small group of people were at the intersection. There were "scrap" marks on the road a short distance up Margaret Street and on the left hand side. (I repeat that I read "scrap" as "scrape".) Senior Constable Forai spoke with Rose Saunders who handed her a wallet. Senior Constable Hatswell confirmed that Saunders said that the rider of the motor cycle had dropped the wallet, and left it there. He believed that Saunders did not identify the rider of the motor bike. Then, after seeing papers in the wallet that belonged to the defendant they walked across the road to 60 King Street where he knew that the defendant lived. Then, after going around the back of the house, Senior Constable Forai spoke to the defendant who appeared extremely intoxicated. He had an injury to his left arm "like grazes and looked like fairly decent graze or cuts to his hand and he was bleeding". The defendant was leaning on the fence and his speech was slurred. When they spoke to him he held up his hand and seemed to indicate that nothing had happened. An ambulance arrived but he declined treatment. Senior Constable Forai then stated her belief on reasonable grounds that he was the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident in the last three hours and that he was required to undergo a preliminary breath test, which the defendant refused. Senior Constable Forai explained the consequence of a refusal and he again refused arguing that the loss of licence was four years. He gave his reason for his refusing that he was having a quiet barbecue.<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Senior Constable Hatswell then tendered an extract from Vic Roads stating that the defendant was a disqualified driver at the time of the offence. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;Senior Constable Hatswell was then cross-examined. He said that the scrapes on the road were fresh, made within a short time. He did not recall any oil or water stain. There was no smashed plastic or glass, and the motor cycle was not found. As to his evidence of seeing abrasions, he said that he was looking for an injury so as to relate it back to the accident. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;That concluded the prosecution evidence.<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant did not give evidence and no evidence was called on his behalf. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the defendant then addressed submissions as to why the charges should be dismissed. As I have already said, the learned Magistrate dismissed the charge of driving while disqualified on the ground that the prosecution had not established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the driver of the motor cycle in the incident the subject of the evidence. That left the charge of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test and it was to that charge that the greater part of counsel’s submissions were directed. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;As counsel’s submission was developed it came down to this. The expression (in s53(1)(c)) "has within the last 3 preceding hours driven or been in charge of a motor vehicle when it was involved in an accident" could be read "conjunctively or disjunctively" in the sense that the element of involvement in an accident could be read disjunctively from the preceding element (or elements if driving or being in charge are regarded separately). It was submitted that a disjunctive reading was correct, and that, so read, the prosecution was required to establish the element of involvement in an accident beyond reasonable doubt. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;That a disjunctive reading was intended was indicated by the structure and operation of other provisions in s53. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of s53(1) required proof of an actual state of affairs. It was submitted that para (d) seemed to imply a heavier onus than just a reasonable belief that there had been an accident; it required proof of the occurrence of "the accident". It was submitted, in effect, that it could not have been intended that the charge under s49(1)(c) could be established merely on proof of a belief on reasonable grounds of the matters specified in s53(1)(c). It was submitted that the word "reasonable" connoted proof on the civil standard. If that were so a criminal charge would be established on a civil burden of proof. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;It was further submitted that if s53(1)(c) required only a belief on reasonable grounds of all of the specified elements, an inconsistency in operation of the legislation would be produced. This supported the construction contended for. The inconsistency was this. If the defendant had undergone the preliminary breath test and exceeded the permitted concentration of alcohol in the blood, a charge under s49(1)(b) must have failed if the prosecution did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that he had driven or been in charge of a motor vehicle. That was seen to have occurred here although on the different offence of driving while disqualified, the charge being dismissed for failure to establish that the defendant was the rider of the motor cycle at the relevant time. The inconsistency was in being convicted of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test when the prosecution could not prove the ultimate charge. The inconsistency was avoided if s53(1)(c) was read disjunctively and the prosecution was required to establish the fact of the accident. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate rejected the submission. He held that the belief on reasonable grounds applied to each of the matters specified in para (c), and found the charge proved. It is clear from the transcript overall that the learned Magistrate found that reasonable grounds existed upon which the informant, Senior Constable Forai, might and did form the belief that within the last three preceding hours the defendant had driven a motor vehicle when it was involved in an accident. It is also apparent that he approached the case on the basis that having so concluded he was satisfied that the charge was proved beyond reasonable doubt. Having so concluded the learned Magistrate convicted the defendant on the charge of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test and made the orders referred to earlier. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;In essence, counsel for the appellant sought to support the appeal on the same basis put to the learned Magistrate. Before referring to his submission I should say something about the question of law in the notice of appeal. As it is expressed the question of law does not explicitly state the point, which is one of construction of s53(1)(c). <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;Before me counsel’s submissions were admirably brief.<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the appellant at once conceded that, objectively considered, reasonable grounds existed on which it was open to the informant, Senior Constable Forai, to form the belief required by s53(1)(c). This being so, counsel said that there was no need to refer to authority on the meaning of the expression "believes on reasonable grounds". The sole contention of counsel for the appellant was that on its proper construction s53(1)(c) required that the occurrence of an accident be established beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted to me, as he had below, that it was open to read the section as meaning that the belief as to reasonable grounds applied to each element. However, the words "when it was involved in an accident" established that the accident must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although there was no punctuation or disjunctive word between "motor vehicle" and "when" it was submitted that the above construction was correct and that it was indicated by the following provisions in s53(1). First, para (a) required the prosecution to prove that the person was found driving or in charge of a motor vehicle. Secondly, para (b) required proof that the driver had been required to stop and remain stopped. Thirdly, it was submitted that para (d) required that "the accident" be proved. As I understood it, the argument relied on the final reference to "the accident". Fourthly, sub-s (2) required proof that the person was found driving or in charge of a commercial motor vehicle. Fifthly, sub-s (4) contemplates proving driving more than three hours before being required to undergo a preliminary breath test. Counsel submitted, having regard to the structure and operation of these provisions of s53, that to interpret para (c) so as to only require a belief on reasonable grounds of all of the matters specified therein would make the offence of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test a different type of offence from the others. The difference would be that para (c) would not require proof beyond reasonable doubt of one or other of the elements in para (c).<br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the approach of counsel for the appellant it is important to keep in mind a proper understanding of the meaning and effect of a statutory requirement that a member of the police force hold a belief on a stated matter on reasonable grounds. The statutory contexts vary and sometimes rather than a belief the state of mind required is a suspicion. In all cases, of course, the expression adopted is to be construed according to its terms in the subject context. I was referred by counsel for the respondent to the following cases which although arising in different statutory contexts indicate the approach taken to such provisions. In short, he said, they indicate that such statutory provisions set out to cure a social ill or need for the law to achieve a certain result by the use of this technique. That is to say, the statutory provisions allow a person such as a police officer to do something when they have a reasonable belief or suspicion and without establishing proof of the requisite fact or matter. The cases referred to were <em>George v Rockett</em>[1], <em>Walsh v Loughnan</em>[2], <em>Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Mitchell</em>[3] and <em>Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Bodouloh</em>[4].<br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;In George the High Court considered s679 of The Criminal Code (Q) which in relation to the power of a justice to issue a warrant to a police officer authorising search and seizure, stipulated that the justice have "reasonable grounds for suspecting" and "reasonable grounds for believing". In the joint judgment of the High Court their Honours said (at 112) that:<br />"When a statute prescribes that there must be ‘reasonable grounds’ for a state of mind – including suspicion and belief – it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person. ... Therefore it must appear to the issuing justice, not merely to the person seeking the search warrant, that reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion and belief exist."<br />Later in the judgment the High Court discussed what was required to establish a suspicion and a belief. After referring to the case of suspicion their Honours said as to belief (at 116) that:<br />"The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of the mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture."<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;In holding that reasonable grounds existed on which it was open to Senior Constable Forai to form the belief provided for in s53(1)(c) the learned Magistrate accepted the evidence as hearsay. That is, the evidence established what was before Senior Constable Forai and thus the grounds on which she formed her belief under s53(1)(c). It is clear from the transcript that he distinguished the evidentiary issue in proof of the charge under s49(1)(c) and the charge of driving while disqualified. <br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;In my view the learned Magistrate was plainly correct in holding, and counsel for the appellant was correct in conceding, that reasonable grounds existed on which it was open to Senior Constable Forai to form the belief referred to in s53(1)(c). <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;With this background I turn to the question of construction. The starting point is to construe s53(1)(c) according to its terms. There is not, as I have observed, any punctuation or language that would suggest that Parliament intended a separation between the two elements of driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle within the last preceding three hours on the one hand, and the vehicle being involved in an accident on the other hand. There is no word or other indication of disjunction. It is one composite statement of that as to which the member of the police force must have a belief on reasonable grounds. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;I do not consider that the contrary construction is indicated, let alone required, by the provisions of s53 relied on by counsel for the appellant or s53 read as a whole. In my view it is readily seen that what Parliament has done in s53(1) and (2) is provide for a series of factual situations in which a preliminary breath test may be required. Each situation is different. Each operates without any reference to the other. It is true that on a charge under s49(1)(c) of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test in the situations described in s53(1)(a) and (b) the prosecution would have to prove the fact of having been found driving or in charge of a motor vehicle or of being a driver required to stop and remain stopped. The situation is the same on a charge based on a refusal under sub-s (2). The remaining provision relied on by counsel for the appellant was sub-s (1)(d). I am I think required by the submission to express my view on that part of the submission, although I would prefer to confine myself to the point strictly in issue. The view I favour of the provision is that it does not require proof of "the accident". That expression refers to the earlier expression "an accident" which, with an immaterial difference in structure, is part of the same composite expression that appears in para (c). Even if I were wrong in that view, the operation and effect of para (c) is clear to the point that it could not be affected thereby. <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;It is useful in considering s53 to bear in mind the social purpose of the legislation. It is part of the provisions concerned to deal with the problem of drink driving and the danger to the public of drivers affected by alcohol. The statutory provisions represent policy decisions by Parliament as to where the line is to be drawn. The obvious situation is where a person is found driving a motor vehicle with an excess concentration of alcohol in their blood. But there may be other situations, and that in s53(1)(c) is one identified by and adopted by Parliament for the purpose of the operation of the preliminary breath test provisions. But the operation of para (c) is not open ended. It is limited in its application to the circumstances it specifies. The language of para (c) defines and limits the circumstances in which a preliminary breath test can be required under it. That is Parliament’s prescription of the operation of the legislation in that situation. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;In my view there is nothing in the language of para (c) or of s53 considered overall that indicates, let alone requires, that the belief on reasonable grounds applies only to the first element of having driven or been in charge of a motor vehicle within the last three preceding hours. That would be to separate the driving from the second element of involvement in an accident in the sense of requiring a different standard of proof to its satisfaction namely proof beyond reasonable doubt. It seems to me that such a reading is not merely contrary to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in para (c) but it defies common sense and logic. The subject matter or situation that para (c) deals with is a person who within the last three hours has driven a motor vehicle when it was involved in an accident. <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;I have not overlooked in this analysis the appellant’s contention that the construction adopted by the learned Magistrate produced an inconsistency in the result on the two charges. In my view there is no inconsistency when regard is had to the purpose of the legislation. Section 53 addresses situations in which a member of the police force may require a person to undergo a preliminary breath test. In the situations in which s53(1)(a) and (b) and (2) apply the request is made to the person found driving or in charge of a motor vehicle. That is one thing, but s53(1)(c), and (d) in my view, comprehend circumstances in which the person is not found driving or in charge of a motor vehicle. Those provisions are to be understood as stating a policy decision of Parliament that in the circumstances specified in them a person may be required to undergo a preliminary breath test. That is understandable as a matter of policy in the area of drink driving. <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;The next step in understanding the operation of the statutory provisions is this. If the person requested refuses to undergo the test he or she may be charged with an offence under s49(1)(c), as the appellant was. If, however, the test was undertaken and the concentration of alcohol in the blood was found to be less than the prescribed maximum there would be no offence under s49(1)(b) and, axiomatically, no offence under s49(1)(c). It is possible that there may be a charge for some driving offence other than drink driving but that is another matter. If, on the other hand, the concentration of alcohol in the blood was found to exceed the maximum permitted the person may be charged with an offence under s49(1)(b). That charge will fail if the prosecution cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was the driver of a motor vehicle. That would have been the situation in this case, and there is what counsel called an inconsistency. <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;In my view however, what counsel described as an inconsistency is not an inconsistency at all but rather the consequence of Parliament’s intention that in the circumstances specified in s53(1)(c) the subject person submit to a preliminary breath test on pain of committing an offence if he or she refuses to do so. The statutory provision reflects the importance that the legislature has placed on persons submitting to a preliminary breath test in the defined circumstances. It was necessary to make refusal to undergo the test an offence as otherwise there would be an absence of constraint on a person requested to do so. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;It remains to refer to the submission of counsel for the appellant that to interpret s53(1)(c) as I have indicated would render the offence of refusing to undergo a preliminary breath test an offence different from those contained in s53(1) because under para (c) it would not be necessary for the prosecution to prove a fact beyond reasonable doubt. In my view this is not correct, as the offence under s49(1)(c) does require the prosecution to prove a fact beyond reasonable doubt, namely that the member of the police force requiring the defendant to undergo a preliminary breath test did believe on reasonable grounds that the matters in s53(1)(c) were satisfied. But more fundamentally, the answer to counsel’s submission is to be found in a proper understanding of the operation of the several provisions in s53. For the reasons I have discussed, para (c) has a clear and understandable operation according to its terms. Further, to construe para (c) as counsel submits would be to place a judicial gloss on the provision and confine its operation in a way that the words do not bear. Indeed, if the second element was to be interpreted as having to be established as a fact beyond reasonable doubt, it may be asked why the same should not apply to the first element. Why one and not the other? Furthermore, once such a requirement is read into the provision it is hard to see what is left of para (c) as it appears in the legislation. What would be left is that a member of the police force who holds a belief on reasonable grounds of the existence of the matters specified in para (c) could require a person to undergo a preliminary breath test but, in the event of a refusal, on a charge under s49(1)(c) would have to prove the existence of the specified matter or matters as a fact beyond reasonable doubt. In my view para (c) does not bear that interpretation or, to put it another way, to place that interpretation upon para (c) would be to significantly and impermissibly change its meaning and intended operation. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;For these reasons the appeal will be dismissed with costs including reserved costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] (1990) 170 CLR 104. <br />[2] [1991] 2 VR 351. <br />[3] (2002) 37 MVR 142 and on appeal at (2004) 8 VR 192. <br />[4] (2003) 144 A Crim R 37.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the appellant Sawyer: Mr NA Hutton, counsel.

Accordingly, S''s submission on that point had no validity.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;In relation to the argument that the Road Rules Victoria are not a law of the Victorian Parliament, the Road Rules were published in the Government Gazette.

Accordingly, there was no arguable case on this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p>BYRNE J:</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;On 10 February 2004, the motorcar of the appellant, Anthony-Ivan-Smart[1] was parked for over two hours in a two hour parking zone in Myers Street, Geelong. Kathy Reynolds, a traffic officer of the respondent, City of Greater Geelong, accordingly served a parking infringement notice. The notice was not complied with and a charge and summons was filed by Ms Reynolds as informant on 17 June 2004 returnable at the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Geelong on 2 September 2004. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;On 14 October 2004, the charge came on for hearing as an opposed matter before the Magistrate. Mr Smart represented himself and pleaded not guilty. The factual basis of the charge, it seems, was not put in issue; Mr Smart preferred to raise a number of legal matters. In the event, the Magistrate found the charge proved, convicted him and imposed a fine of $50 with $125 costs with a stay to 11&nbsp;November 2004. On 13&nbsp;November 2004, Mr Smart filed a notice of appeal. It is irregular in at least one significant respect: the document describes as respondent the City of Greater Geelong, and not Ms&nbsp;Reynolds. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;In his notice of appeal Mr Smart raises five questions of law:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Does the Greater Geelong City Council have legal standing to bring this action? <br />2. What jurisdiction was the venue of the Magistrates’ Court at Geelong constituted in? <br />3. Is the document entitled “Road Rules-Victoria” a law of the Parliament of Victoria? <br />4. Has Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II., as lawful Sovereign of the United Kingdom and of this State of Victoria, given Her personal signification and pleasure to the Constitution Act 1975, No 8750/1975, of the Parliament of Victoria? <br />5. Who is the “Crown in right” of the State of Victoria?</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;On 25 February 2005, Master Evans refused the application for appeal pursuant to Rule 58.09. Mr Smart appeals against the Master’s order by notice of appeal filed on 2 March 2005. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;I shall address in turn each of the questions of law which were advanced by Mr&nbsp;Smart: </p>\r\n<p>1. Does the Greater Geelong City Council have legal standing to bring this action?</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;The point taken here was that the municipality was incorporated by statute under the name Greater Geelong City Council[2] there is no legal entity known as “City of Greater Geelong”. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;There is no substance in this point. The short answer is that the municipality, by whatever name, was not the informant; it was Ms Reynolds. This appears from the charge and summons and from the certified order of the Magistrates’ Court. I am not persuaded that there is here an arguable case. </p>\r\n<p>2. What jurisdiction was the venue of the Magistrates’ Court at Geelong constituted in?</p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;This point was not pressed. </p>\r\n<p>3. Is the document entitled “Road Rules-Victoria” a law of the Parliament of Victoria?</p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;In 1999 the Parliament of the State of Victoria adopted a set of Road Rules as part of a nationwide standardisation of traffic law developed by the National Road Transport Commission and endorsed by the relevant ministers in the Australian Transport Council. This was achieved by the regulation-making power conferred by s95 of the Road Safety Act 1986. On 9 November 1999, the Road Safety (Road Rules) Regulations 1999 (SR No. 120/1999) were made by the Governor in Council. By Regulation 201(1) it is provided that the Road Rules published in the Government Gazette on 28&nbsp;October 1999 are to be read as if they formed part of the regulations. The consequence of this is that the Road Rules are part of the law of Victoria[3]. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;The point taken by Mr Smart is that s32 of the Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984 (Vic) requires that, where a subordinate instrument incorporates a document such as the Road Rules, then the Minister must lodge a copy of the document and of the notice of the document with the Clerk of the Parliaments and publish it in the Government Gazette. He contended that the Regulations or the Road Rules, or perhaps both, were invalid for non-compliance with this provision. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;It is known that the Road Rules were published in the Government Gazette on 28&nbsp;October 1999. I would, in any event, be prepared to find, in the absence of contrary evidence, that all of these steps had been taken. There is a rebuttable presumption of regularity which has the effect that public acts of this nature are taken to be properly performed unless evidence is led to show that this is not the case. But it is not necessary that I act upon this presumption, for s32(5) provides that a failure to comply with these requirements “does not affect the validity, operation or effect of the subordinate instrument”. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;I mention, too, that Regulation 202 provides that the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) applies to the interpretation of the Road Rules and that this Act, by s46AA, permits an instrument to incorporate a document by reference. It may be, however, that the point raised by Mr Smart is not one of interpretation. <br />13.&nbsp;There is no arguable case for relief here. </p>\r\n<p>4. Has Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II., as lawful Sovereign of the United Kingdom and of this State of Victoria, given Her personal signification and pleasure to the Constitution Act 1975, No 8750/1975, of the Parliament of Victoria?</p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;This is a very confusing and confused argument. As best I understand it Mr Smart contended that the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic) was invalid so that any Act of the Parliament performed thereafter, including the passing of the Road Safety Act 1986 and the regulations made under that Act were likewise invalid. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;The argument seems to be this. The Commission given to his Excellency Sir Henry Winneke as Governor of Victoria on 18 April 1974 conferred upon him certain powers, including those contained in Letters Patent dated 29 October 1900 which constituted the office of the Governor of Victoria. On that date in 1900, too, Her Majesty Queen Victoria issued certain instructions to the Governor which included in cl.&nbsp;VII: </p>\r\n<p>“The Governor shall not, except in the cases hereunder mentioned, assent in Our name to any Bill of any of the following classes:- ... 2 Any Bill whereby any grant of land or money or other donation or gratuity, may be made to himself...”</p>\r\n<p>The Constitution Act 1975 included provisions with respect to the Governor’s salary.</p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;Mr Smart also referred me to the Australian States Constitution Act 1907 (Eng) which required that a bill of an “Australian State Parliament which affects the salary of the Governor must be reserved for the signification of His Majesty’s pleasure thereon”. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Included in Mr Smart’s exhibits was a copy of the Constitution Act 1975 with the signature of the Governor there appearing under the following words:<br />&nbsp;<br />“I reserve this bill for the signification of Her Majesty’s pleasure thereon”.</p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;Finally, I was provided with an extract from the Government Gazette of 19&nbsp;November 1975 which shows that the Bill was so reserved and that “by an Order in Council dated the 22nd day of October 1975, Her Majesty has been pleased to assent to same”. The proclamation recording this is signed by the Governor and dated 18&nbsp;November 1975. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;In the circumstances, if the legal position was as Mr Smart outlined it, it is clear enough that the Constitution Act 1975 was properly assented to. There is no substance in this point and no arguable case here. </p>\r\n<p>5. Who is the “Crown in right” of the State of Victoria?</p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;I regret that I found Mr Smart’s development of this point entirely incomprehensible. Nor is it apparent to me that anything about this topic could have a bearing upon the validity of the conviction which he seeks to impugn. I am not persuaded that there is here an arguable case. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Master was correct in refusing the application for appeal under s92 of the Magistrates’ Court Act. The appeal against the Master’s order will be refused. The order of the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Geelong made on 14 October 2004 stands.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] Notwithstanding that I was told that the correct surname of the appellant was Mr Anthony-Ivan-Smart, I refer to him in the interests of brevity as Mr Smart. <br />[2] City of Greater Geelong Act 1993 s5.

Four of the employees spoke to the general manager (Hilton) and were told that there was a possibility that their symptoms could have been caused by exhaust emissions from a forklift and that they should “take a break” and if they felt better to return to work and if they did not feel better, to go home. Later that day all of the employees were admitted to hospital showing signs of substantial exposure to carbon monoxide.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, charges were authorised to be laid against Oxford for breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (‘Act’) including the failure of Oxford to provide adequate facilities for the welfare of employees. At the hearing it was submitted that the informant was not authorised either generally or in the particular case to bring the proceedings. This submission was rejected and after a hearing the magistrate found the charges proved. Upon appeal to a Judge of the Supreme Court Oxford''s appeal was dismissed. </p>\r\n<p>Upon appeal—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Appeal dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;The Act by s48(2) provides that an inspector must have authority in writing of the Authority "given generally or in any particular case". It is not necessary for the prosecutor to give evidence that the prosecution case answers the description of the prosecution to which consent has been given. It is for the accused to rebut the presumption that the consent refers to this prosecution. The informant''s authority to prosecute was an authority to prosecute in this particular case. Despite that it did not refer to the circumstances with which the proceeding was concerned, it described the prosecution in terms which were capable of accommodating the prosecution and Oxford did not show that the approval did not relate to the prosecution. It is clear that proof of authorisation is essential to the validity of a prosecution for an offence. But it is not an element of the offence and therefore, so long as a defendant does not object that a prosecutor’s authorisation has not been proved, the authorisation will be presumed in accordance with the presumption of regularity. Needless to say, if objection is taken, it will be necessary for the prosecutor to prove the authorisation. But because the authorisation is not an element of the offence, the standard of proof of the authorisation is only on the balance of probabilities. In the result, an authorisation may ordinarily be proved by production of an authority in writing and oral testimony as to the nature and provenance of the document.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The offence alleged was one of failing to provide first aid or medical treatment and of failing to provide transport home. It was not alleged that the appellant failed to ensure that the employees availed themselves of first aid or medical treatment or transport home. In the circumstances, the court was not in error in finding the charges proved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>CALLAWAY JA:<br />1.&nbsp;This was an appeal to the Trial Division from the Magistrates’ Court pursuant to s92 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. The case was heard on 4th June 2003 and the learned trial judge handed down reasons on 18th November 2003. His Honour said that he would hear counsel in relation to consequential orders and costs. On 2nd December 2003 his Honour ordered that the appeal be dismissed and that the appellant pay the respondent’s costs, including any reserved costs. Those orders were authenticated on 4th December 2003. They are the orders from which Chernov JA and I granted leave to appeal, limited to two grounds only, on 17th December 2003.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The appeal book contains not only the orders of 2nd December 2003 but also another document purporting to be an authenticated order. It recites that orders were made on 18th November 2003, mistaking the reasons for the orders. Unsurprisingly, it does not record the orders that were made on 2nd December 2003. The document is a nullity. The Court should order that it be cancelled and removed from the file. The notice of appeal, dated 19th December 2003, also refers to “the judgment ... delivered on 18 November 2003”. The notice of appeal should be amended to refer to the orders made on 2nd December 2003.</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;In his outline of submissions counsel for the appellant advanced two contentions which, arguably, were not within the scope of the limited leave to appeal that was granted. One contention was that s21 of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 did not empower the Victorian Workcover Authority to delegate its power under s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 to authorize an inspector to bring proceedings for an offence against that Act. The other contention was that, in any event, the delegation was ineffective because it was not made to an individual personally but to the person for the time being holding an office or position. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;It is unnecessary to decide whether those contentions were within the scope of the leave granted because, for the reasons given by Nettle JA, which I have had the benefit of reading in draft, the appeal should in any event be dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>NETTLE JA:<br />5.&nbsp;This is an appeal from orders made on 2 December 2003 in the Common Law Division, dismissing an appeal from orders made on 13 December 2002 in the Magistrates’ Court at Sunshine that the appellant be convicted of offences against s21(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985.</p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;On 29 December 1999, seven students working as casual employees of the appellant were adversely affected by carbon monoxide produced by a forklift operating inside a freezer room at the appellant’s premises. After suffering symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea and lethargy, four of the employees attended at the appellant’s office. They asked to speak to the general manager, Mr Gabor Hilton, who was known to some of them, but before Mr Hilton came to speak to them, another officer of the appellant, Mr Luiz Fleiszig, entered the reception area and they began to describe their symptoms to him. As they did so Mr Hilton arrived and mentioned that it was possible that their symptoms had been caused by exhaust emission from the forklift. He told them to “take a break” and if they felt better to return to work, and if they did not, to go home. The three employees who had not gone to the office continued working for a short period of time, but as they felt progressively more unwell, they too attended at the office and met the four employees who had spoken to Fleiszig and Hilton. All seven of them then decided that they did not feel well enough to continue work and that they would go home. Later that day, all were admitted to hospital suffering markedly elevated carboxy-haemoglobin blood levels, a sign of substantial exposure to carbon monoxide.</p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The appellant was charged with four offences against s21(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, namely:</p>\r\n<p>(1) In contravention of ss21(1) and 21(2)(a), failing to provide and maintain plant and systems of work that are so far as is practicable safe.<br />(2) In contravention of ss21(1) and 21(2)(c), failing to maintain the workplace in a condition that is safe.<br />(3) In contravention of ss21(1) and 21(2)(d), failing to provide adequate facilities for the welfare of employees at any workplace under the control and management of the appellant. <br />(4) In contravention of ss21(1) and 21(2)(e), failing to provide such information, instruction, training and supervision to employees as are necessary to enable the employees to perform their work in a manner that is safe. </p>\r\n<p>After a hearing that spread over five days, the appellant was found guilty as charged and convicted and fined the sum of $50,000. <br />8.&nbsp;On appeal to the judge below, his Honour was required to consider two questions[1]:</p>\r\n<p>“(a) whether for the purposes of section 48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 the informant was authorised either generally or in the particular case to bring the proceeding against the Appellant? And</p>\r\n<p>(b) whether for the purposes of section 21(2)(d) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 the alleged failure of the Appellant to do the acts alleged against it in the Respondent’s further and better particulars of charge in respect of charge 3 amounts to or is capable in law of amounting to a failure to provide adequate facilities for the welfare of employees?”</p>\r\n<p>The judge answered both questions affirmatively and, as Callaway JA has noticed, the leave to appeal granted on 17 December 2003 was confined to grounds that the judge had erred in so answering. Two grounds of appeal are advanced.</p>\r\n<p>Ground 1 - Authority to prosecute<br />9.&nbsp;Section 48 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 provides that:</p>\r\n<p>“48. Proceedings may be brought by inspectors etc.<br />(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Act may be brought by the Authority[2] or an inspector.<br />(2) No proceedings for an offence against this Act shall be brought by an inspector without the authority in writing of the Authority given generally or in any particular case.<br />(3) An authority under sub-section (2) shall be sufficient authority to continue proceedings in any case where the Court amends the charge, warrant or summons.<br />(4) An inspector may conduct before the Court any proceedings brought by the inspector.<br />(5) The Authority must issue general guidelines for or with respect to the prosecution of offences under this Act.<br />(6) The Authority must publish guidelines under sub-section (5) in the Government Gazette.”</p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;Section 21 of the Accident Compensation Act 1985 provides, however, that:</p>\r\n<p>“21. Delegation (1) The Authority may, by instrument under its common seal, delegate to any person any function or power of the Authority under this Act or any other Act including, subject to sub-section (3), this power of delegation.<br />…<br />(3) A person to whom a function or power has been delegated under sub-section (1) may, subject to and in accordance with the approval of the Authority given generally or in a particular case, by instrument in writing, or in the case of a body corporate that has a common seal, under its common seal, authorise another person to perform the function or exercise the power so delegated.<br />(4) An authority given by a delegate of the Authority under sub-section (3) may be revoked at any time by the delegate by instrument in writing and, where a delegation under which the authority was given is revoked, the authority is revoked.<br />(5) Any act or thing done in the performance of a function or the exercise of a power by a person to whom that function or power is delegated by the Authority under sub-section (1) or by a person authorised by a delegate of the Authority under sub-section (3) to perform that function or exercise that power has the same force or effect as if it had been done by the Authority.<br />(6) Where the performance of a function or the exercise of a power by the Authority is dependent on the opinion, belief or state of mind of the Authority in relation to a matter and that function or power has been delegated under sub-section (1), that function or power may be performed or exercised by the delegate or by a person authorised by the delegate under sub-section (3) upon the opinion, belief or state of mind of the delegate or of the authorised person, as the case may be, in relation to that matter.<br />(7) The giving of an authority under sub-section (3) does not prevent a performance of the function or the exercise of the power by the person by whom the authority was given.<br />(8) Where a person purports to perform a function or exercise a power under this Act, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is established, that the person is duly authorised by a delegation under sub-section (1) or by an authority under sub-section (3) given pursuant to such a delegation to perform the function or exercise the power.<br />(9) A delegation under sub-section (1) or the giving of an authority under sub-section (3) may be made subject to such conditions or limitations as to the performance or exercise of any of the functions or powers to which it relates or as to time or circumstance as is specified in the instrument of delegation or in the authority.<br />(10) A delegation must not be made under this section to any person, other than a Director of the Board appointed under section 25 or 26 or an officer or employee of the Authority, in respect of any power, function, authority or discretion to which section 14 of the Dangerous Goods Act 1985 applies.”<br />11.&nbsp;Before the Magistrates’ Court the informant relied on an authority to prosecute dated 5 June 2001, purportedly issued under s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, as follows:</p>\r\n<p>AUTHORISATION OF PROCEEDINGS<br />Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (VIC)<br />Equipment (Public Safety) Act 1994 (Vic)<br />Barry Durham, being the person occupying the position or performing the duties of Executive Director, Health &amp;

It argued that although the tenor of the document was to authorise proceedings, it failed to specify the dates or other particular circumstances with which the proceedings were concerned. Thus in the appellant’s submission, the document did not identify the proceedings which it purported to authorise. That meant, it was said, that the document failed to qualify as an “authority” within the meaning of s48(2).</p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;The judge below rejected that argument. His Honour said that:</p>\r\n<p>“43. The written authorisation provided by the Authority to the informant was to bring ‘the proceedings’ against Oxford..., in relation to specified sections of the OHS Act. The charge and summons served on [the] defendant contained charges which accorded completely with the document granting authority to bring proceedings. One needs to do no more than look at the authorities given to the informant and at the charges alleged against the [party] to see that the authorities authorise those charges. As Higgins J said in Berwin v Donohoe[3], the prosecution brought ‘answers the description of the prosecution to which consent has been given ... It is for the accused to show that the written consent which on its face, and without any straining of words, can fit this prosecution, does not relate to it’. In my view, the informant was authorised to bring proceedings for the alleged offences against the specified sections of the OHS Act.” . </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;The appellant contends that the reliance which the judge placed on Berwin v Donohoe was misplaced. It says that his Honour overlooked or ignored what the appellant contends is an important distinction between s3(6) of the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 (Com)[4], which provided simply that “... A prosecution for an offence against this section shall not be instituted without the written consent of the Attorney-General,” and the requirements of s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act: that an inspector must have authority in writing of the Authority “given generally or in any particular case”. The appellant submits that whereas it may have been sufficient compliance with s3(6) of the Trading with the Enemy Act to produce an authority which did not specifically identify the authorised proceedings, under s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act it is necessary to produce an authority which is either general or which specifically authorises a particular case, and that the authority in fact produced was neither. It was not a general authority, because it was confined to specified charges and, according to the appellant, it was not an authority in a particular case, because it did not specify sufficient dates, facts and circumstances to enable identification ex facie of the offences the subject of the case. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;In my opinion there is no relevant difference between s3(6) of the Trading with the Enemy Act and s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Section 3(6) of the Trading with the Enemy Act provided that:</p>\r\n<p>“(6) A prosecution for an offence against this section shall not be instituted without the written consent of the Attorney-General.”</p>\r\n<p>And as has been seen, s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides that:</p>\r\n<p>“(2) No proceedings for an offence against this Act shall be brought by an inspector without the authority in writing of the Authority given generally or in any particular case.”[5]</p>\r\n<p>The only significant difference between the two provisions is the words “given generally or in any particular case”, and as it appears to me those words do not say anything about the degree of precision required of an authority in a particular case. Their purpose and effect is to make clear that an authority may be given generally as well as in a particular case[6]. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Strictly speaking, the words may have been an unnecessary inclusion in s48(2) because, if s48(2) referred simply to “authority”, it would presumably encompass general authority as well as authority in a particular case. But I suspect the fear was that, without the words “given generally”, s48(2) might be construed as requiring a separate authority in each particular case, and that having then decided to include the words “given generally”, it was thought necessary as a matter of drafting to make express reference to authority “in any particular case”, lest the express reference to the general be taken as excluding the particular[7]. The technique appears to be common enough. Examples of it may be found in several other statutes[8]. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;As it seems to me, the appellant’s argument also proceeds upon a misconception that s3(6) of the Trading with the Enemy Act is to be read as providing only for general consents and that that was the basis of the decision in Berwin v Donohue. For the reasons already given, I consider that s3(6) provided just as much as s48(2) for consent in particular cases – the point of distinction between the two provisions is that s3(6) may not have gone as far in providing for general consents – and in my opinion the consent which was in issue in Berwin v Donohue was a consent in a particular case. As the consent is set out in the judgment of Higgins J it was that:</p>\r\n<p>“The Attorney-General for the Commonwealth of Australia hereby consents to a prosecution being instituted against Alfred George Berwin of Sydney in the State of New South Wales for an offence against the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914.”[9]</p>\r\n<p>Higgins J left no doubt that he regarded that as a specific consent:</p>\r\n<p>“It is said that this consent is not sufficiently specific, does not specifically refer to this particular prosecution. It is not pretended that there is any other prosecution to which it could possibly refer. There is only one offence specified in the information, an offence under sec. 3 (see Acts Interpretation Act 1904, sec. 8); and there is no offence mentioned in the Acts that requires the consent of the Attorney-General except an offence against sec. 3. It is quite true that the words in the written consent might also be applicable to some other offence than that specified in the information; but the words are distinctly applicable to that so specified. An indictment of John Smith would not be bad because there are other John Smiths to whom it might refer. A devise in a will of ‘my farm in the parish of ''Wycombe'' is not void for uncertainty even if the testator had two farms in that parish; and evidence would be admissible to show which farm was referred to. Here there are not two prosecutions of Berwin, and the difficulty of showing which prosecution is referred to does not arise. The words of the Act providing for the consent of the Attorney-General are similar to those found in leases providing for the consent of the landlord to an assignment. If we had before us the words ‘an assignment of the lease shall not be made without the written consent of the lessor’, and if the lessor signed a written consent to ‘assignment’, without restricting it to assignment to any definite person, how could anyone say that there was a breach of the covenant? </p>\r\n<p>Inasmuch as the prosecution in this case answers the description of the prosecution to which consent has been given, it is not necessary for the prosecutor to give evidence identifying the former with the latter. It is for the accused to rebut the presumption that the consent refers to this prosecution (Sewell v Evans[10] ; Leake on Contracts, 5th ed., p137). It is for the accused to show that the written consent which on its face, and without any straining of words, can fit this prosecution, does not relate to it (and see R v Metz[11]). Even if there were two prosecutions to which the consent would be equally applicable, evidence would be admissible to show to which the consent is applicable; the consent would not be a bad consent. There would be a sufficient description even if evidence had to be given to show to which prosecution the consent referred Shardlow v Cotterell[12]; Plant v Bourne[13]). I am clearly of opinion that the objection to the conviction is groundless, and that the rule nisi, so far as it relates to this ground, should be discharged.”[14]</p>\r\n<p>To the same effect, Isaacs J said:</p>\r\n<p>“Now, here the Attorney-General signed a consent in these terms:– ”The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth hereby consents to a prosecution being instituted against Arthur George Berwin for an offence against the Trading with the Enemy Act.” </p>\r\n<p>No other section than sec. 3 requires such consent, and the presumption is that the consent was given with reference to sec. 3. No other prosecution or offence or challengeable conduct on the part of Berwin within the purview of the Act is suggested. In short, there is nothing but the present set of circumstances to which, so far as appears, the consent could possibly have reference, and the consent was entrusted to the Crown officer Donohoe actually prosecuting in this particular case.”</p>\r\n<p>And later:</p>\r\n<p>“...If the defence definitely challenges the fact that the Attorney-General has examined the facts of that particular case, the prosecution may be put to prove that he has; but, as I say, no such challenge was made here. The objection was merely as to the form of the documents. Then I see no distinction between this and a consent specifying sec. 3. Sec. 3 embraces a multiplicity of offences any one of which may have been or may not have been the subject of a consent merely specifying the whole section. In my opinion the protection intended by the sub-section has been fully afforded, and the objection should be overruled.”[15]</p>\r\n<p>Powers J agreed with Higgins and Isaacs, JJ[16]. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;The net result of the reasoning[17] in Berwin v Donohue was therefore that a consent for a prosecution was to be regarded as valid for the purposes of a section which contemplated that consent might be given in a particular case, and only arguably allowed consent to be given generally, if the prosecution fell within the terms of the consent, and that was so whether or not there were any other prosecutions capable of falling within the terms of the consent.</p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;Since s48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act is a section which contemplates that authority may be given in a particular case, and which allows consent to be given generally, logic implies that the same reasoning is applicable. In each case it is simply a question of whether the prosecution answers to the description of a prosecution which has been authorised. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;Consequently, I agree with the judge that the informant’s authority to prosecute was an authority to prosecute in this particular case. Despite that it did not refer to the circumstances with which the proceeding was concerned, it described the prosecution in terms which were capable of accommodating the prosecution and the appellant did not show that the approval did not relate to the prosecution.</p>\r\n<p>S48(3) not redundant<br />22.&nbsp;The appellant submitted that the adoption of that view would render s48(3) redundant. I do not think that is so. The fact that s48(2) expressly provides for general authorities means that there may be authorities cast in general terms. In such cases s48(3) is unlikely to apply. But it is distinctly possible that an authority might be drafted with precision, and s48(3) appears designed to deal with the possibility of amendment in such a case. To take an example suggested by Mr Holdenson, it may be that an authority specifies precisely the paragraph of s21(2) upon which reliance is placed, and after the evidence begins it is realised that the case is more accurately to be characterised as falling under another paragraph. The prosecutor could well be given leave to amend, but if it were not for s48(3) it might be said that the charge as amended was not authorised. </p>\r\n<p>Authority not unintelligible<br />23.&nbsp;In the course of reply the appellant’s solicitor advanced a further argument, that the authority was in any event unintelligible. As I understood that contention, it was that because the authority refers to “these proceedings against A.B. OXFORD COLD STORAGE...” without defining “these proceedings”, it is impossible to know what it means. But the answer is surely as Mr Holdenson submitted, that in context the expression “these proceedings” is to be read as “the following proceedings” and then in what follows the proceedings are defined in terms of proceedings for offences pursuant to section 47(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act in relation to the following sections:</p>\r\n<p>Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (Vic)<br />Section 21(1) &amp; (2)(a) &amp; 47(1) – one charge<br />Section 21(1) &amp; (2)(c) &amp; 47(1) – one charge<br />Section 21(1) &amp; (2)(d) &amp; 47(1) – one charge<br />Section 21(1) &amp; (2)(e) &amp; 47(1) – one charge.</p>\r\n<p>That is intelligible and in the absence of any suggestion that there may have been some other proceedings, it is sufficiently precise.</p>\r\n<p>The admissibility of viva voce evidence<br />24.&nbsp;The appellant argued that the magistrate was wrong in law and that the judge below was in error in not determining that the authorisation was deficient on its face. The thrust of that contention was that the magistrate was wrong to act on the basis of oral testimony as to the administrative steps taken preceding the issue of the authority and to place reliance upon the presumption of regularity. The appellant submitted that:</p>\r\n<p>• s48(2) requires authority in writing and accordingly that there was no basis for the receipt of oral evidence for the purposes of proving the authorisation;<br />• the presumption of regularity is only capable of application in circumstances where there is a gap in the evidence, and it is said that there were no gaps in the evidence;<br />• in any event, it was not permissible to invoke the presumption of regularity, because the effect of the presumption would be to shift the burden of proof to the defence.</p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;Taking each of those propositions in turn, there is in my opinion no inconsistency between the requirement for authority to be in writing and the receipt of oral testimony to establish the nature and provenance of the authority in writing. As has already been seen, Berwin v Donohoe explains why it was not necessary that an authorisation to bring a prosecution precisely identify the authorised proceeding. It is sufficient that the description of the authorised proceeding be adequate to encompass the actual proceeding and that there be no suggestion of other prosecution or offence or challengeable conduct on the part of the accused[18]. Consistently with that sort of approach, an informant might well give oral evidence or tender other documentary evidence to prove that the description of proceedings in an authority in writing relates to the subject proceeding. Oral and other written evidence might also be given to prove such things as the execution of the authority and that the prosecutor holds an office to which the authority applies.</p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;Turning then to the presumption of regularity, it is trite that courts will not presume the existence of facts which are central to an offence[19]. It is also clear that proof of authorisation is essential to the validity of a prosecution for an offence[20]. But it is not an element of the offence[21] and therefore, so long as a defendant does not object that a prosecutor’s authorisation has not been proved, the authorisation will be presumed in accordance with the maxim omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta[22]. Needless to say, if objection is taken, it will be necessary for the prosecutor to prove the authorisation. But because the authorisation is not an element of the offence, the standard of proof of the authorisation is only on the balance of probabilities[23]. In the result, an authorisation may ordinarily be proved by production of an authority in writing and oral testimony as to the nature and provenance of the document[24].</p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;I see nothing in what was decided by the magistrate or the judge that runs counter to those principles.</p>\r\n<p>Power to approve – delegable<br />28.&nbsp;As Callaway JA has explained, the appellant sought leave to put a further argument, which was not put below: that the Authority’s power to approve a prosecution under s.48(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act should be construed as a non-delegable power and that, since the prosecution of the appellant was approved only by a delegate of the Authority, the prosecution was invalid. The argument is based on s47(3) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which. provides that:</p>\r\n<p>“(3) An offence against this Act (not being a contravention of or failure to comply with a provision of the regulations) shall be an indictable offence.”</p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;According to the appellant, there is a long established principle of law that the class of persons who may bring proceedings for indictable offences is limited. The appellant says that it would be contrary to that principle, and a result that Parliament cannot possibly have intended, if the Authority were able to delegate its power to approve prosecutions to a wider class of persons. The appellant submits therefore that s21 of the Accident Compensation Act must be construed purposively so as to exclude that possibility, and that the appropriate way to do that is to treat the power to approve prosecutions as a power to which s21 simply does not apply.</p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;I do not think that the argument is persuasive. I accept of course that a presentment for an indictable offence may only be preferred against an accused person by the Director of Public Prosecutions or a Crown Prosecutor[25]. So unless an indictable offence is to be tried summarily, it follows that the class of persons who may initiate a prosecution for an indictable offence is effectively limited to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Crown Prosecutors[26]. But there are a number of exceptions, like s48 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which specifically authorise other persons to institute summary proceedings for certain types of indictable offences, and there are also a large number of indictable offences that may otherwise be tried summarily[27]. In those cases the procedure is governed by s54 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 and the class of persons authorised to institute summary proceedings is much broader. Furthermore, since the power conferred by s48(2) to prosecute offences under the Occupational Health and Safety Act is given only to inspectors, and since inspectors may only be appointed by the Authority (and the Authority may not delegate its power to appoint inspectors), the persons who may institute a prosecution are necessarily limited to persons appointed by the Authority. It is plainly not the case that the decision to prosecute may devolve upon just any one regardless of how appropriate they may be to make the decision. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;The argument was also put in an alternative form which I do not think to be any more persuasive. As I understood it, it was contended that the Authority’s own power to prosecute under s48 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act should be construed as a non-delegable power - because, it was said, if the Authority could delegate its own power to prosecute to any one it chose, it would render otiose the provisions of s48 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act that enable prosecutions to be brought by inspectors – and hence unless the power to approve prosecutions is also construed as a non-delegable power, there would be a nonsensical inconsistency as between the power of prosecution and the power to approve prosecutions. </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;If I have understood the contention correctly, it may be disposed of without making any determination about the extent to which the Authority may delegate its power to prosecute. Assuming without deciding that the scope for delegation were unlimited, it would mean only that while the Act contemplates that prosecutions will ordinarily be brought by inspectors, the Authority retains the ability to authorise others from time to time also to bring prosecutions. Prosecutions by inspectors must be approved under s48(2) on a case by case basis, by the Authority or its delegate. But it is conceivable that the Authority might wish to delegate the power to prosecute under s.21 of the Accident Compensation Act in a fashion which does not require any further approval. If on the other hand the Authority’s ability to delegate its power to prosecute were limited, it would not follow that the same limitation should apply to the ability to delegate the power to approve a prosecution by an inspector. Since all inspectors must be appointed by the Authority, and it is clear that the Authority may not delegate the power to appoint inspectors, there will always be the protection that prosecutions brought by inspectors will be brought by persons whom the Authority has individually approved for the task. </p>\r\n<p>Delegation to holder of an office<br />33.&nbsp;The appellant argued as well that if s21 of the Accident Compensation Act allows the Authority to delegate its power to approve prosecutions, the delegation can only be given to a named person and thus not to the holder of an office for the time being or from time to time and that, since the power to approve prosecutions was in this case delegated to the person from time to time occupying the position or performing the duties of Chief Executive of the Authority, the authority was invalid. The appellant concedes, as it must, that s42A(2) of the Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984 provides that a power to delegate to the holder of an office includes a power to delegate to the person acting in or performing the functions and powers thereof for the time being. But the appellant submits that because the powers or functions of some positions or offices may be ill-defined or uncertain, one could never be sure whether a person purporting to act in or perform the functions and powers of an office or position was an eligible recipient of a delegation, and hence it must be supposed that the power of delegation is limited to delegation to named delegates.</p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;I am not persuaded by either aspect of that argument. As to the first aspect, authority makes plain that a power of delegation expressed in terms like s21 of the Accident Compensation Act allows for delegation to the holder of an office or to a person performing the duties of an officer. In Owendale Pty Ltd v Anthony[28] Windeyer J at first instance was concerned with a notice given by a delegate of the Minister of the Interior to terminate a lease under the City Area Leases Ordinance 1936-1963 (A.C.T.). Section 6 of the Ordinance provided that the Minister might delegate to any person or authority all or any of his powers and functions under the Ordinance (except the power of delegation). The delegation in fact given was to “the person for the time being holding or performing the duties of an office specified in the First Schedule to this Instrument” and then in the Schedule a number of offices were named. It was argued that the delegation was ineffective because it was not to a named person but to the holder of an office or person performing the duties of that office. Windeyer J rejected the argument as follows:</p>\r\n<p>“...there might perhaps have been some room for argument, were it not for the decision of Starke J. in Noble and Bear v The Commonwealth[29]. Since then, delegations to the holders of specified offices have become commonplace in the administrative system of the Commonwealth; and provided that there be an identifiable person the holder of the office, I consider they are a valid exercise of a statutory power to delegate ‘to any person’. Whether it is desirable that Ministers should make wholesale delegations of discretionary powers and functions was questioned. But it is not a matter which can concern me. The Minister remains responsible for the action of his delegate.”[30]</p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;The appellant submits that Owendale is distinguishable because it was concerned with civil proceedings, and that it should be assumed that a higher standard is expected in criminal proceedings. But subsequent authorities have held that it is applicable to criminal proceedings, and to judicial review proceedings involving the liberty of the subject[31], and in point of principle there is no reason why it should not be. As has already been noticed, even in criminal proceedings the standard of proof required in establishing authority to prosecute is proof on the civil standard.<br />36.&nbsp;As to the second aspect of the argument, whatever be the functions and powers of a particular office, common sense and experience suggest that it will ordinarily be clear enough whether a person is for the time being holding or performing the duties of the office[32]. Consequently, in the ordinary case there will be adequate certainty as to whether such a person is an eligible recipient of a delegation. Problems might arise occasionally, but they are likely to be of a sort capable of being dealt with on a case by case basis. The possibility that they may occur is therefore not a reason to suppose that the power of delegation in s21 of the Accident Compensation Act excludes delegations to the holder of an office or person acting in or purporting to perform the duties of the office. </p>\r\n<p>Ground 2 – Failing to provide adequate facilities<br />37.&nbsp;The appellant’s sole contention in support of ground 2 is that the judge erred in holding that the facts of which particulars were given were capable in law of constituting the offence of failing to provide adequate facilities for the welfare of employees in the workplace within the meaning of s21(2)(d) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act[33]. According to the appellant, the obligations imposed by s21(1) including those imposed by s21(2)(d) are obligations of an ongoing or continuous nature: to provide appropriate systems of work, facilities and the like, and they do not require an employer to ensure that employees make use of such systems and facilities as may be provided. On that basis the appellant argues that the alleged failure to provide first aid or medical treatment was incapable of constituting a failure to provide systems of work, facilities and the like. It says that at most it was a failure to ensure that employees made use of facilities.</p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;In my opinion the argument proceeds upon a misconception of the way in which the case was put below. The offence alleged was one of failing to provide first aid or medical treatment and of failing to provide transport home. It was not alleged that the appellant failed to ensure that the employees availed themselves of first aid or medical treatment or transport home. Perhaps the particulars might have been drafted more precisely: in terms of failing to provide facilities for first aid and medical treatment and failing to provide facilities for a lift home. But even as drafted, they seem to have left no doubt as to what was intended[34]. As the appellant rightly says, employees cannot ordinarily be compelled to receive first aid or medical treatment, or to be driven home. Usually, therefore, an employer charged with an offence of failing to provide facilities is unlikely to conclude that he has been charged with failing to ensure that his or her employees made use of facilities. And in this case the appellant was under no such mistake. It is plain from the way in which the case was run before the magistrate and before the judge below that such a possibility did not cross anyone’s mind. It follows that even if the particulars could be construed in the fashion now suggested, it would not be a basis for setting the convictions aside.</p>\r\n<p>Conclusion <br />39.&nbsp;In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>BYRNE AJA.:<br />40.&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of both Callaway JA and Nettle JA. I concur in their reasons and agree that the appeal should be dismissed. I agree also with the other, essentially procedural, orders proposed by the presiding judge.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] Among other issues.<br />[2] The WorkCover Authority: see Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985, s4.<br />[3](1915) 21 CLR 1 at 28-29.<br />[4] Which was the provision in question in Berwin v Donohue.<br />[5] Emphasis added.<br />[6] Or particular cases, see: Interpretation of Legislation Act 1984, s37.<br />[7] In accordance with the maxim expressum facit tacitum cessare: Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd v The Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia (1932) 47 CLR 1 at 7; R v Wallis; Ex parte HV Mackay Massey Harris Pty Ltd (1949) 78 CLR 529 at 550; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (1992) 175 CLR 564 at 575; PMT Partners Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (1995) 184 CLR 301 at 311-312; Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 111.<br />[8] Evidence Act 1995 (Com), s110(1): “... either generally or in a particular respect ... of good character”; Legal Profession Act 1987 (NSW), s55(1): “a person appointed by instrument...either generally or in a particular case”; Migration Act 1958 (Com), s66D(1): “either generally or as otherwise provided by the instrument of delegation”, and see Singh v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 90 ALR 397 at 402.<br />[9] (1915) 21 CLR at 28; it appears in a slightly different form in the judgment of Isaacs J, ibid at 25.<br />[10] 4 QB 626.<br />[11] 31 TLR 40.<br />[12] 20 Ch D 90.<br />[13] [1897] 2 Ch 281.<br />[14] (1915) 21 CLR at 28-29.<br />[15] (1915) 21 CLR at 25-26.<br />[16] (1915) 21 CLR at 38.

The Act does not apply to all persons who commit sexual offences. It applies to only those offenders who were, immediately before 1 October 2004, undergoing a sentence for a registrable offence, as a result of which sentence the offender was being supervised in some way. Accordingly, a magistrate was not in error in finding that a person who was undergoing a wholly suspended sentence for a registrable offence immediately before 1 October 2004 was not an existing controlled registrable offender.<br /><br />HARGRAVE J:<br />FACTS <br />1.</strong>&nbsp;On 11 March 2004, the respondent was convicted in the County Court of Victoria at Melbourne of three counts of sexual penetration of a child aged between 10 and 16 years of age, contrary to s48(1) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 (Vic). The respondent was sentenced to a total effective sentence of eight months’ imprisonment ("the sentence"). The sentence was wholly suspended for a period of 12 months.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;On 13 January 2005, the respondent attended the Springvale Police Station, where he was served with a notice of reporting obligations ("the notice") dated 6 January 2005. The notice stated that the respondent was a "registrable offender" within the meaning of the <em>Sex Offenders Registration Act </em>2004 (Vic) ("the Act"). Further, the notice advised the respondent that he was required to report to Victoria Police within 28 days and comply with reporting obligations under the Act. The notice advised the respondent to telephone a specified toll free number to arrange a time to report, and stated that serious penalties may apply to any person who fails to comply with reporting obligations under the Act. At the time of service of the notice, a member of Victoria Police explained to the respondent his obligations in relation to the notice. The respondent then signed an acknowledgment to confirm receipt of the notice. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The respondent failed to report to Victoria Police within 28 days of receipt of the notice. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;In 15 March 2005, the respondent attended the Springvale Police Station where he was interviewed in relation to the offence of failing to comply with his reporting obligations without reasonable excuse, in contravention of s46(1) of the Act. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;In the interview, the respondent admitted receiving the notice and failing to comply with his reporting obligations. He said that his reasons for failing to do so were because he was scared of what was going to happen and because he was taking medication for psychosis which affected his judgement. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The respondent was charged on summons dated 31 March 2005 with failing to comply with his reporting obligations under the Act ("the charge"). The charge was heard in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria at Dandenong on 26 October 2005. The only issue which was argued before the magistrate was one of statutory interpretation. The parties joined in requesting the magistrate to determine, as a preliminary issue, whether the respondent was an "existing controlled registrable offender" within the meaning of the Act. If he was not, then it was acknowledged by the prosecution that the charge ought be dismissed. The magistrate decided the issue in favour of the respondent and dismissed the charge. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;By notice of appeal dated 25 November 2005, the appellant appealed to this Court under s92(1) of the <em>Magistrates Court Act </em>1989 (Vic) on a question of law. The sole ground of appeal is that: <br />"The learned magistrate erred in finding that the respondent, who was undergoing a wholly suspended sentence for a registrable offence immediately before 1 October 2004, was not an ‘existing controlled registrable offender’ as defined by the [Act]."<br /><strong>RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ACT <br />8.</strong>&nbsp;The purpose of the Act is stated in s1(1) in the following terms:<br />"1. Purpose and outline<br />(1) The purpose of this Act is—<br />(a) to require <u>certain offenders </u>who commit sexual offences to keep police informed of their whereabouts and other personal details for a period of time—<br />(i) to reduce the likelihood that they will re-offend; and<br />(ii) to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of any future offences that they may commit;<br />(b) to prevent registered sex offenders working in child-related employment;<br />(c) to empower the Police Ombudsman to monitor compliance with Part 4 of this Act." (Emphasis added.<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Section 1(2) of the Act contains an outline of the Act. Relevantly, s1(2)(b) provides:<br />(2) In outline this Act—<br />(b) requires <u>certain offenders </u>who are sentenced for registrable offences on or after 1 October 2004 to report specified personal details for inclusion in the Register (and extends this requirement to <u>certain offenders </u>sentenced for registrable offences before that date);" (Emphasis added.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Section 2 of the Act provides that the Act came into operation on 1 October 2004. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;Section 3 of the Act contains a number of relevant definitions. For present purposes, I note that "registrable offence" has the meaning set out in s7 of the Act and "registrable offender" has the meaning set out in s6 of the Act. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;It is common ground that the offence of which the respondent was convicted was a "Class 1 offence" within the meaning of the Act and was thus a "registrable offence" within the meaning of s7 of the Act.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The question is whether the respondent is, as a result, a "registrable offender" within the meaning of s6 of the Act. Section 6(1) provides:<br />"(1) Subject to sub-sections (3) to (6), a registrable offender is a person whom a court has at any time (whether before, on or after 1 October 2004) sentenced for a registrable offence."<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;As I have said, it is common ground that the respondent was sentenced for a registrable offence. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;One of the sub-sections to which s6(1) is subject is s6(4), which provides:<br />"(4) Unless he or she is a registrable offender because of sub-section (2) or is an existing controlled registrable offender, a person is not a registrable offender merely because he or she was sentenced for a registrable offence before 1 October 2004."<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;It is common ground that the respondent is not a registrable offender because of s6(2). The issue for determination is whether the respondent is an "existing controlled registrable offender" within the meaning of the Act. If he is, then he is a "registrable offender" within the meaning of the Act. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Section 3 of the Act defines "existing controlled registrable offender" in the following terms:<br />"existing controlled registrable offender means a person who, as a result of having been sentenced for a registrable offence, was under the supervision of a supervising authority or any other person or body immediately before 1 October 2004;"<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;In order to understand the definition of "existing controlled registrable offender" it is necessary to refer to other definitions contained in s3 of the Act. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;"Sentence" is defined in an inclusive manner. The definition includes any order that is a "sentencing order" within the meaning of the <em>Magistrates'' Court Act</em>. A sentencing order within the meaning of the <em>Magistrates'' Court Act </em>includes any order made under Part 3 of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991 (Vic). Part 3 of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>provides for the full range of sentences, including sentences involving no supervision of the offender, for example, a fine or a suspended sentence. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;"Supervised sentence" is defined in a manner which includes a sentence referred to in s6C(1) of the <em>Corrections Act </em>1986 (Vic). Section 6C(1)(d) refers to:<br />"(d) A person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment that was wholly or partly suspended and who is in the community in accordance with that sentence."<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;"Supervising authority" is defined in the following terms:<br />"‘supervising authority’, in relation to an offender, means the authority prescribed by the regulations as the supervising authority of the class of offender to which he or she belongs."<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;At the time of the alleged contravention by the respondent of his reporting obligations,[1] reg 18 of the <em>Sex Offenders Registration Regulations </em>2004 ("the Regulations") made the following provision concerning the identity of a "supervising authority" for the purposes of the Act:<br />"18. Supervising authority<br />(1) For the purpose of section 50(3) of the Act, the person or body that is required to give notice to a registrable offender is the supervising authority specified in column 2 of Table A in the Schedule for the class of offender specified in column 1 of the Table to which the registrable offender belongs.<br />(2) For the purpose of section 53 of the Act, the person or body that is required to give notice to the registrable offender is the supervising authority specified in column 2 of Table B in the Schedule for the class of offender specified in column 1 of the Table to which the registrable offender belongs."<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;At this time, reg 18(2) contained an obvious error. It referred to notice being given under s53 of the Act "to a registrable offender". In fact, s53 of the Act requires notice to be given "to the Chief Commissioner of Police". Prior to the hearing of the charge, this obvious error was the subject of amendment to correct the error.[2] Nothing turns on the existence of the error in reg 18(2) at the time of the alleged offence and the laying of the charge. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Relevantly, item 2 of Table A of the Regulations provides that where a registrable offender is sentenced for a registrable offence by the County Court, as was the respondent, the supervising authority required to give notice under s50(3) of the Act is the County Court.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;It is arguable that the relevant supervising authority for the purposes of s50(3) of the Act in relation to a registrable offender who is sentenced for a registrable offence before 1 October 2004 is the Secretary of the Department of Justice. Such an interpretation is open because items 1 to 7 of Table A use the future tense to describe the class of offender in column 1. Such offenders include a person "who is sentenced", "who is released" or "who enters Victoria". If this be correct, the supervising authority for the purposes of s50(3) of the Act is, under item 8 of Table A, the Secretary of the Department of Justice. Item 8 of Table A describes the class of offender as any registrable offender "not referred to in items 1 to 7". However, having regard to the view which I take of the issue on appeal, it is not necessary for me to decide this question. <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Relevantly, item 3 of Table B of the Act provides that, when an adult registrable offender ceases to be subject to a supervised sentence, the supervising authority required to give notice to the Chief Commissioner of Police under s53 of the Act is the secretary of the Department of Human Services. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Section 50 of the Act provides for written notice to be given to a registrable offender of his or her reporting obligations in certain circumstances. Under s50(3), that notice is to be given by the person or body specified in, or determined in accordance with, the Regulations. As appears above, reg 18(1) provides for a person or body described as the "supervising authority" in column 2 of Table A of the Regulations to give the notice. The identity of the "supervising authority" differs according to the class of registrable offender specified in each item of column 1 of Table A. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;Section 53(2) of the Act requires "the supervising authority" to give notice to the Chief Commissioner of Police in the events specified in s53(1). As appears above, reg 18(2) provides that the "supervising authority" who is to serve the notice is the person or body described in column 2 of Table B of the Regulations. The identity of the "supervising authority" differs according to the class of registrable offenders specified in column 1 of Table B of the Regulations. <br /><strong>THE MAGISTRATE’S DECISION <br />29.</strong>&nbsp;The learned magistrate expressed her conclusions succinctly. In her Honour’s view, the respondent was not under any supervision immediately before 1 October 2004 because the sentence was wholly suspended and thus did not involve any actual supervision by any person. Further, her Honour was of the view that the Regulations did not have the effect that there was any "supervising authority" in relation to the respondent immediately before 1 October 2004 because the Regulations operated prospectively only.<br /><strong>APPELLANT’S ARGUMENTS <br />30.</strong>&nbsp;On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that, as a result of the respondent having been sentenced for a registrable offence, he was, immediately before 1 October 2004, under the supervision of either: <br />(1) a "supervising authority" as defined in s. 3 of the Act; or (2) another person or body. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;The first limb of the appellant’s argument depended upon the definition in s3 of the Act of "supervising authority". It was submitted that the definition of "supervising authority" must have been intended to apply to persons sentenced for registrable offences prior to 1 October 2004, because otherwise the reference to supervision by a supervising authority would have no work to do in the definition of "existing controlled registrable offender". <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, this argument does not address the question of statutory interpretation which I must decide. The mere fact that there may be a body which is, within the definition in the Act, a "supervising authority" in relation to a person sentenced for a registrable offence before 1 October 2004 does not answer the question of whether that person was in fact "under the supervision" of that "supervising authority". In this regard, it was acknowledged by Mr Ryan SC, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, that neither the Act nor the Regulations contain any provision empowering a "supervising authority" to supervise a person convicted of a registrable offence or stating the manner of permitted or required supervision. The Act and Regulations are completely silent on these issues. <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;In circumstances where the respondent was undergoing a wholly suspended sentence, Mr Ryan could not point to any evidence of supervision of the respondent by either the County Court or the Secretary of the Department of Justice. Nor could he point to any power of the County Court or the Secretary of the Department of Justice to supervise the respondent as a result of him being sentenced to a wholly suspended sentence for a registrable offence. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;In effect, the first limb of the argument made on behalf of the appellant depends upon the Act providing that, whenever there is a "supervising authority" in respect of a person sentenced for a registrable offence, there is a deemed supervision of that person. I do not accept that the definition of "existing controlled registrable offender" is directed at deemed supervision. It is concerned, in plain words, with actual supervision. <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;Having regard to my view on the first limb of the submissions on behalf of the appellant, it is not necessary to decide whether the magistrate was correct in her view that there was no "supervising authority" in relation to the respondent immediately before 1 October 2004. The issue is of no consequence if actual supervision is required by either the supervising authority, if there be one, "or any other person or body" at the relevant time. <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;The second limb of the appellant’s argument, that the respondent was in fact under the supervision of a person or body other than a supervising authority, relied upon a form of inchoate supervision arising from the possibility that a person undergoing a wholly suspended sentence may commit an offence punishable by imprisonment during the operational period of the suspended sentence, and thus be guilty of an offence under s31(1) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991 (Vic). <br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;Sub-section 31(1) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991 provides:<br />"31. Breach of order suspending sentence<br />(1) If at any time during the operational period of a suspended sentence of imprisonment, the offender commits, whether in or outside Victoria, another offence punishable by imprisonment, the offender is guilty of an offence for which he or she may be proceeded against on a charge filed by a prescribed person or a member of a prescribed class of persons."<br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;Under sub-ss31(5) and 31(5A) of the <em>Sentencing Act</em>, where a court finds a person guilty of an offence under s31(1), the court must restore the sentence or part thereof which was suspended unless it would be unjust to do so in view of any exceptional circumstances which have arisen since the order suspending the sentence was made. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that, having regard to the provisions of s31 of the Sentencing Act, there was a level of supervision over any person undergoing a suspended sentence because of the possibility that a charge may be filed under s31(1). <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;I reject this submission. In my view, the definition of "existing controlled registrable offender" is directed at persons who are actually under the supervision of a person or body at the relevant time. The fact that it is possible that a person undergoing a suspended sentence may contravene s31(1) of the <em>Sentencing Act</em>, and thus be charged with that offence, does not amount to supervision within the ordinary meaning of the word. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;"Supervision" is defined in the <em>Macquarie Dictionary </em>as:<br />"the act or function of supervising; oversight; superintendence."<br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;"Supervise" is defined in the <em>Macquarie Dictionary </em>in the following way:<br />"to oversee (a process, work, workers, etc.) during execution or performance; superintend; have the oversight and direction of."<br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;"Superintend" is defined in the <em>Macquarie Dictionary </em>in the following way:<br />"to oversee and direct (work, processes, affairs etc.); exercise supervision over (an institution, place, etc.)."<br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, supervision involves the act of supervising. The fact that some action may be taken against a person if certain events occur in the future does not involve any active supervision of that person. Nothing is required to be done in relation to that person unless and until the specified event occurs. <br /><strong>45.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Ryan made an alternative submission under the second limb of his submissions. It was submitted that the Act clearly intended to include a wholly suspended sentence for a registrable offence within the definitions of "sentence" and "supervised sentence". Reference was made to the definitions of "sentence" and "supervised sentence", in s3 of the Act, each of which includes, a sentence which is wholly or partly suspended. <br /><strong>46.</strong>&nbsp;Further, in this regard, reference was made to s27(5) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>which provides, with certain immaterial exceptions, that:<br />"A wholly suspended sentence of imprisonment must be taken to be a sentence of imprisonment for the purposes of all enactments except..."<br /><strong>47.</strong>&nbsp;Although I accept that the legislature intended to include a wholly suspended sentence for a registrable offence within the definitions of "sentence" and "supervised sentence", this does not, in my view, assist the appellant. If the legislature had intended to include within the definition of "existing controlled registrable offender" any person who was undergoing a "sentence" or "supervised sentence" for a registrable offence immediately before 1 October 2004, it could easily have done so. Alternatively, if this was the intention of Parliament, there would have been no need for a definition of "existing controlled registrable offender" in the Act. Instead of the words "or is an existing controlled registrable offender" in s6(4), Parliament could, and in my view would if that was its intention, have said "or was undergoing a sentence or supervised sentence for a registrable offence immediately before 1 October 2004."<br /><strong>48.</strong>&nbsp;Such an approach to the interpretation of the Act does not deprive the definitions of "sentence" and "supervised sentence", to the extent that they include a suspended sentence, of any work to do in the Act. Under s50(2)(a) and s50(3) of the Act, and reg 18(1) of the Regulations, a registrable offender must be given notice under s50 by the specified "supervising authority" as soon as practicable after he or she is sentenced for a registrable offence. Under s53(1)(c) and s53(2) of the Act and reg 18(2), the Chief Commissioner of Police must be given notice by the specified "supervising authority" when a registrable offender ceases to be subject to a supervised sentence. <br /><strong>49.</strong>&nbsp;I am accordingly of the view that the respondent was not an "existing controlled registrable offender" immediately before 1 October 2004. As a result, I am of the opinion that s6(4) of the Act has the effect that the respondent is not a registrable offender within the meaning of the Act. <br /><strong>50.</strong>&nbsp;In reaching my conclusion, I have considered whether the result which I have reached is so inconsistent with the purpose and object of the Act that a strained construction, such as that contended for by the appellant, ought be adopted.[3] In my view, the construction which I prefer does not offend the purpose and object of the Act. As I have emphasised, the purpose and object of the Act is to require "certain offenders who commit sexual offences to keep police informed of their whereabouts and other personal details". The purpose of the Act is not to apply to all persons who commit sexual offences. This is particularly so in respect of persons sentenced for a registrable offence before 1 October 2004. Clearly, the Act does not intend to subject all such persons to its regime. In this regard, Parliament has made a choice to include some but not all persons convicted of registrable offences under Victorian law prior to 1 October 2004. It is apparent that Parliament has made a policy decision to include only those offenders who were, immediately before 1 October 2004, undergoing a sentence for a registrable offence, as a result of which sentence the offender was being supervised in some way. <br /><strong>51.</strong>&nbsp;For the above reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] 11 February 2005, being 28 days after service of the notice on 13 January 2005. <br />[2] <em>Sex Offenders Registration (Amendment) Regulations </em>2005 (Vic), SR 94/2005, reg 7. <br />[3] Compare s35(a) <em>Interpretation of Legislation Act </em>1984 (Vic); <em>Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) </em>(1981) 147 CLR 297.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the appellant DPP: Mr C Ryan SC, counsel.

His normal duties involved assessing benefit claims including primary claims for benefits, special benefit claims and urgent payment requests. During 1998 - 2000 A. defrauded the Commonwealth of $92,149.84 of which $85,139.84 was paid out to 75 different Centrelink beneficiaries by way of unauthorised payments to clients under financial hardship and by reducing loan balances to zero and issuing new loans. A. was subsequently charged in relation to these offences and on the plea it was said that A. wished to help private persons with budgetary problems and there was no personal benefit to A. There was a delay of more than two years between interview and the time A. was charged. The sentencing judge imprisoned A. for 9 months but ordered that he be released immediately on entering into a recognisance in the sum of $1000 to be of good behaviour for 2 years and to undergo a community-based order to perform 100 hours of unpaid community work and undergo assessment and treatment for drugs or alcohol dependency or psychological treatment. Upon appeal—<br /><br /><strong>HELD: Appeal dismissed.<br />1.&nbsp;Per Callaway and Eames JJ A: On appeal, the DPP was required to show that the sentencing discretion has been shown to be manifestly erroneous. Having regard to the unusual circumstances of the case, the ground of appeal was not made out.<br />2.&nbsp;Per Nettle JA: The prosecutor submitted that there is in effect a special "rule" or "practice" of sentencing that serious frauds on the revenue will result in custodial sentences of which at least some part must be served immediately. Views may differ as to whether the "rule" or "practice" rises any higher than the application of general sentencing principles to the particular considerations which apply in cases of tax and welfare fraud. Whilst general deterrence is of particular significance in such cases, the practical result or consequence is that a custodial sentence will be necessary unless the particular circumstances are sufficiently exceptional. Whilst the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, having regard to the delay in laying the charges, the principle of double jeopardy and the limitations inherent in a Crown appeal, it would be inappropriate for the Court to intervene.<br /><br />CALLAWAY JA:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment prepared by Nettle JA. I agree with his Honour that the appeal should be dismissed, but I have reached that conclusion by a more direct route.<br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>R v Osenkowski</em>[1], in a passage which has often been cited, King CJ said: <br />“It is important that prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges. There must always be a place for the exercise of mercy where a judge’s sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case. There must always be a place for the leniency which has traditionally been extended even to offenders with bad records when the judge forms the view, almost intuitively in the case of experienced judges, that leniency at that particular stage of the offender’s life might lead to reform.”<br />In my opinion this was such a case. Leniency, very considerable leniency, was extended by an experienced judge in what were accepted by the Crown to be unusual circumstances.[2] There was accordingly no departure from principle or violation of sentencing standards. <br /><br /><strong>EAMES JA:</strong><br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Nettle JA and I gratefully adopt his Honour’s review of the facts and competing contentions on this appeal. Whilst I agree with his Honour that the appeal should be dismissed, I have reached that conclusion on the basis that the Director has failed to establish that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, the cases to which we were referred in which courts have made strong statements about the need for deterrent sentences in cases involving social security fraud have only limited application to this case. As Mr Silbert conceded, the circumstances of the offending in this case were unique. The judge described it as being an exceptional case and concluded that the respondent had played the role of a “self-appointed good Samaritan”. The judge concluded that the respondent had not been shown to have gained any personal financial benefit from his offences. However, given that he did not use his own money to fund his “good” work, the appropriate analogy, as Mr Silbert pointed out, would have been closer to Robin Hood.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Although complaint was initially made that the judge placed too much weight on the untested assessment and opinion of psychologist Mr Jeffrey Cummins, no objection was taken to its tender before the judge, and in my view he was entitled to make use of it as he did. His Honour accepted that the respondent acted as a result of feeling compassionate towards the clients who attended the Centrelink office, and in circumstances where he felt responsible for dealing with difficult and often homeless and intimidating clients. Those motives do not render these victimless crimes or crimes which do not constitute a serious breach of trust. His Honour accepted that to be so and said that general deterrence was an important sentencing consideration. They were not, however, crimes of the character which have motivated the strongest statements by the courts about social security fraud.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Insofar as general deterrence was required to be reflected in the sentence, the deterrent message would have been primarily directed towards other government employees who held similar positions of trust. As a result of his offending this respondent lost the job he had held for more than ten years, he had been convicted of numerous serious criminal offences, and he had been ordered to make a substantial repayment by way of reparation. Facing trial and sentence he had undergone an ordeal over a prolonged period, suffering depression as a result. I am by no means convinced that those to whom the deterrent message would have been aimed would not have been suitably deterred by those consequences alone. To suggest that only a period of actual imprisonment would have sufficed to achieve that objective seems to me to overstate the reality of the case. Sentencing judges must not ignore the principles stated in s17A(1) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1914 (C’th) that the court shall not impose a sentence of imprisonment for a federal offence unless the Court, after considering all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case. [3]<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;In this case Mr Silbert conceded that the sentence of nine months imprisonment which was imposed on count 1 was within range. The sole complaint was that he was not ordered to serve an immediate custodial sentence. The respondent pleaded guilty, had no prior convictions, and was accepted to be remorseful. He was in ill health, and had experienced stress whilst subject to the considerable delay that took place while the offences were investigated. The cases justifying intervention to allow a Director’s appeal will be rare and exceptional[4]. That is particularly so where the offender had been released into the community by the sentencing judge and where allowing the appeal would result in his incarceration[5]. Where the discretion that has been exercised was to wholly suspend a sentence that exercise of discretion must be shown to be manifestly erroneous[6]. I am not persuaded that the sentencing discretion has been shown to have been wrongly exercised in this case. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The ground of appeal has not been made out, and I would dismiss the appeal. <br /><br /><strong>NETTLE JA: </strong><br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;On 30 July 2004 the respondent pleaded guilty before the County Court at Melbourne to two counts of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s29D of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1914 (Cth): the first against the Department of Family &amp; Community Services[7] between 12 July 1998 and 25 August 2000 in relation to social service payments in the sum of $85,139.84 (Count 1); and the second against the Department of Family &amp; Community between 26 March 1999 and 27 July 2000 in relation to social security payments in the sum of $7,010.00 (Count 2). After a plea in mitigation, on 10&nbsp;August 2004 the judge sentenced the respondent on Count 1 to be imprisoned for a term of nine months but ordered that he be released immediately on entering into a recognisance release order in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for two years; and, on Count 2, to a community based order for one year with conditions that he perform 100 hours of unpaid community work during a period of 12 months from the date of the order and that he undergo assessment and treatment for drugs or alcohol dependency or psychological assessment treatment.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The Director of Public Prosecutions now appeals against the sentence pursuant to s567A of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;The facts of the matter may be stated briefly. The respondent was employed by Centrelink as a Customer Services Officer between 22 January 1990 and 20&nbsp;November 2000. During the period in which the offences were committed he was located at the Centrelink Customer Service Centre at 123-127 Cecil Street, South Melbourne. His normal duties involved assessing benefit claims including primary claims for benefit, special benefit claims and urgent payment requests. He was also responsible for reviewing client entitlements and he conducted new claims seminars. He was a “counter officer” and the first point of contact for the public attending the Centre for urgent payment assistance. During the period between 12 July 1998 and 25 September 2000 he defrauded the Commonwealth of $92,149.84, of which $85,139.84 was paid out to 75 different Centrelink beneficiaries, in part in the form of excess payments of arrears, in part by the back-dating of claims, in part by the improper excuse of Centrelink loans, in part by the improper adjustment of overpayment debts, and in part by payment in circumstances where there was no application for or entitlement to payment. Funds were dispersed in a number of ways, including by direct credit to beneficiary bank accounts and by the issue of electronic benefits transaction cards.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Police began an investigation into the respondent’s activities following receipt of information that he may be making unauthorised or fraudulent payments to Centrelink beneficiaries. The respondent was interviewed on 23 October 2000 at which time he made generalised admissions as to making unauthorised payments to clients in financial hardship and to reducing loan balances to zero and issuing new loans. He denied, however, that he had received any personal benefit from the unauthorised payments and thereafter he made no further comment. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;A large amount of the money has since been recovered by withholding payments from ongoing entitlements and by other debt recovery procedures. There are some cases, however, in which beneficiaries have shown that they received the funds in good faith, and in those cases recovery has been waived. At the time of sentencing, $57,227.01 had been recovered, a further $21,245.60 had been waived and the outstanding sum was $29,122.83 for which a reparation order was made. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The judge noted that the defalcations were multifarious and that they were well concealed and difficult to detect. The judge was also of the view that the offences were clearly dishonest and involved scant regard for the protection of the revenue. But his Honour accepted that the offences were informed by the respondent’s wish to help private persons with budgetary problems and were not of personal benefit to the respondent except as to the $7,010 the subject of Count 2. His Honour was also persuaded that there were significant mitigating circumstances in the delay of more than two years between the time at which the respondent was first interviewed and the time of the respondent being charged; the respondent’s admissions; the respondent’s pleas of guilty; his remorse; health problems; strong employment history and lack of prior convictions; the extent of recovery and the respondent’s ability to repay what remained outstanding; and the strong support provided to the respondent by his wife, brothers and parents. <br /><strong>The Crown’s contentions<br />15.</strong>&nbsp;In the Director’s written outline of argument it was contended that the sentences imposed were so manifestly inadequate as to be indicative of error of principle. As the argument was there put, each of the individual sentences was in itself inadequate and the structure of the total sentence, coupled with the judge’s failure to impose an immediate custodial sentence, was evidently the result of a failure to accord sufficient weight to the respondent’s culpability and the need to reflect general deterrence in the sentence, particularly in light of the judge’s characterisation of the offences as well concealed and difficult to detect. It was submitted that general deterrence requires special emphasis in cases of fraud against the social security system, and that the sentence imposed on Count 1 was so disproportionate to the seriousness of the offences as to aggrieve the public conscience. It was also said that comparison with comparative sentences for substantial social security fraud demonstrated the manifest inadequacy of the sentence. Alternatively, it was contended that even if the duration of the sentence imposed on Count 1 were not manifestly inadequate, there was no basis upon which the judge could reasonably have exercised his discretion wholly to suspend the sentence. <br /><strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>Upon the appeal coming on to be argued, Mr Silbert for the Director said that it was no longer contended that a sentence of nine months imprisonment on Count 1 was outside the available sentencing range. The argument was limited, he said, to the contention that the sentence imposed on Count 1 was manifestly inadequate because of the judge’s order wholly to suspend the sentence. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Silbert submitted that there is in effect a special “rule” or “practice” of sentencing that serious frauds on the revenue will result in custodial sentences of which at least some part must be served immediately. It is expressed, he said, in a number of authorities, including the decision of the Full Federal Court in <em>The Queen v Whitnall</em>[8] and the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in <em>R v Purdon</em>[9] and the decision of this court in <em>DPP v Milne</em>[10]. Mr Silbert accepted that circumstances in some cases may be so exceptional as to warrant departure from the rule, and hence result in a wholly suspended sentence. But he submitted that the circumstances of this case were clearly not of that type. To the contrary, he said, the offences here involved fraud upon the Commonwealth in respect of the relatively large sum of $90,000; they were committed over a sustained period of two years extending from 12 July 1998 to 25 August 2000; they involved the large number of 196 transactions and 75 separate beneficiaries; they were exacerbated by concealment; and they were plainly dishonest and committed with scant regard for the protection of the revenue which it was the respondent’s duty to protect. In Mr Silbert’s submission, the correct application of principle necessitated a custodial sentence, of which some part should be served immediately, and the judge had plainly erred by wholly suspending the sentence without any or adequate reason for the adoption of that course. <br /><strong>The respondent’s contentions<br />18.</strong>&nbsp;Not surprisingly, the submissions made on behalf of the respondent emphasised that Crown appeals are to be brought only in rare and exceptional cases to establish a point of principle; the need for the Crown to demonstrate specific error; and, in the absence of an identifiable error, the very high threshold over which the Crown must pass in order to show that the sentence is so manifestly inadequate as to constitute error of principle. Mr Croucher also repudiated the suggestion that there is a special rule or practice of sentencing applicable to social security frauds. Indeed, he said, the very idea of it flies in the face of sentencing principles properly understood. In the alternative, Mr Croucher emphasised the principle of double jeopardy as it applies to Crown appeals and the consequent imperative that it is only in very clear and rare cases of manifest inadequacy or error that a Crown appeal against sentence should be allowed. He called in aid the decision of this court in <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v Trainor and Cahir</em>[11] as support for his contention. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Trainor and Cahir </em>the offenders were the directors of a mailing house and were convicted of defrauding the Commonwealth of $750,000 over a period of 12 months. They had done so by causing bulk mail to be delivered to Australia Post for distribution without submitting any mailing statements either at the time of lodgement of the mail or at all. As the mailing house was a charge account customer, Australia Post relied on the mailing statements in order to charge the correct postage on the mail lodged. Since the returns were not submitted, nothing or less than was due was charged. Each offender was ordered to make reparation in the sum of $750,000 and sentenced to be imprisoned for a term of 18 months. But it was further ordered that each be released immediately pursuant to s20(1)(b) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1914 upon entering into a recognizance in the sum of $5,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the sentences on the ground of manifest inadequacy, but the appeal was dismissed. Batt JA, with whom Callaway JA agreed, rejected the contention that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and was persuaded that it was open to the judge to order immediate release. His Honour considered that the order for immediate release was warranted by the facts that there had been a delay of more than two years between interviewing the offenders and charging them; that the offenders had continued to carry on their business honestly and successfully; that a large measure of reparation had been commenced; that the offending was out of character; and that each offender was said to have achieved a large degree of rehabilitation and had excellent prospects for further rehabilitation. Callaway JA added that it was in his opinion just the kind of case in which a court of criminal appeal should not intervene,[12] for he considered that the trial judge’s sentencing remarks contained a careful and discriminating assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances and that, while the sentence was “undoubtedly merciful” [13], mercy did not necessarily betoken error. Tadgell JA was persuaded that the sentences were manifestly inadequate, given that the offences were constituted of deliberate deceit over a protracted period and “on a grand scale”, and his Honour would have sentenced the offenders to at least half as much again. But he would not have been prepared to direct by way of re-sentence that any part of a term newly imposed should be served immediately. In his Honour’s view, the delay since the commission of the offences and the fact that the offenders had avoided incarceration to that point meant that it would [not] be appropriate to inflict incarceration upon them.<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Croucher submitted that very similar considerations apply in this case. There was a long delay between the commission of the offences and the laying of charges; there has been no satisfactory explanation of that delay; the offending was aberrant; and the respondent has excellent prosects of rehabilitation and of satisfying the reparation order. What is more, whereas the offenders in <em>Trainor &amp; Cahir </em>had profited to the extent of $750,000, the respondent here got nothing. So, he submitted, even if the sentence were manifestly inadequate, it would be inappropriate to direct by way of re-sentence that any part of the term newly to be imposed should be served immediately. <br /><strong>Social security fraud and custodial sentences<br />21.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>R v Carter</em>[14] Winneke P warned that ritual incantations such as “serious frauds on the revenue will result in custodial sentences” are of little practical value, because “serious” must inevitably depend upon the finding of the sentencing judge in the case under consideration. With respect that is undoubtedly true. Plainly, there are cases, particularly in the area of social security fraud, where the mitigating circumstances render the imposition of a custodial sentence both cruel and excess to needs. Such is the inevitable consequence of the nature of social security payments and the difficult personal circumstances of those who most often claim them. Hence, as it is put in <em>Fox &amp; Freiberg</em>[15]: <br />“Standard mitigatory factors such as the making of restitution and an early plea and co-operation with the authorities, have application to social security offences as to others, but some may carry more weight in this context than in others. Thus, social security offenders may be more likely to carry significant financial commitments or face serious financial difficulties, be more insecure in their employment and fear the consequences of loss of their allowances and benefits, suffer from ill-health and have a generally disadvantaged background. The effect of imprisonment on the beneficiary’s family may be greater than is usual, if they are sole parents or are taking care of aged parents. Many of those charged with the most serious offences, particularly where the offences have been carried out over a long period of time, are considerably older than the average offender. Females represent over 40 per cent of offenders in the higher courts, a far higher proportion than that for offences generally.” <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;It is nevertheless often said in the authorities, albeit often in vain[16], that those who commit serious frauds against the revenue should be punished with custodial sentences and that such sentences should include a period actually to be served.[17] Decisions of the Federal Court and of the various state courts do indeed support the existence of a “rule” or “practice” that those who commit serious frauds on the revenue should be punished with custodial sentences and that, especially in cases involving tax and welfare fraud, the sentence should include a period actually to be served. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;So, for example, in <em>The Queen v Whitnall</em>[18], which concerned offences of tax evasion over a four year period totalling $74,667.14, Higgins J, with whom Davies and Drummond JJ agreed, expressed the rule or practice in terms that: <br />“At least, so far as the Courts are concerned, serious frauds on the revenue will result in custodial sentences. In the absence of “substantial mitigating circumstances”, that sentence will include a period actually to be served.”<br />Significantly, however, they held that the trial judge had not erred in imposing a wholly suspended sentence.<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;Similarly, in <em>R v Purdon</em>[19], which concerned fraudulent claims resulting in the over-payment of social security benefits over a period of years totalling approximately $87,000, Hunt CJ at CL expressed the proposition thus: <br />“The [sentencing] judge did not refer expressly in his remarks on sentence to the strongly worded statements of this Court that make it clear beyond any doubt that, in the case of a fraud upon the social security system, a custodial sentence is to be imposed unless there exist very special circumstances justifying some lesser order. It is unnecessary to refer to the very many judgments which have re-stated and applied that proposition. It is sufficient to refer only to three: <em>Regina v Van Tung Luu </em>(CCA, 7 December 1984, unreported) at 3; <em>Regina v David Fernanda Medina </em>(CCA, 28 May 1990, unreported) at 4; <em>Regina v Mears </em>(1991) 53 A Crim R 141 at 145. An attempt was made to distinguish those cases by reference to their facts, but those statements made were intended to go beyond the facts of those particular cases and to be of universal application. In my view, it is too late to challenge those statements now.”<br />Then after referring to the particular circumstances of the case, his Honour continued: <br />“There were indeed compelling subjective circumstances shown in this case. The manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed, however, demonstrates that the judge must have acted upon some wrong principle or upon a misunderstanding or a wrong assessment of the evidence: <em>Regina v Tait </em>(1979) 24 ALR 473 at 476-477. The judge has paid no regard at all to the principle of deterrence, which is of vital importance in these cases. I am unable to see how the matters specified by him could amount to `very special circumstances which would justify a non-custodial sentence’. The rationale stated for the rule that a custodial sentence is to be imposed for social security fraud except in very special circumstances is that the offence is easy to commit but difficult to detect, it is widespread, and the introduction of more checks upon applicants for social security would cause delays in the payment of benefits and therefore hardship to those whose need is urgent. It has also been said that the rule reflects a concern for the protection of the revenue, but I would prefer to express it as a concern for the additional burden upon all taxpayers who shoulder the heavy burden of providing the funds for the social security system to operate and the even heavier burden created by the widespread abuse to it by frauds such as these. The rule is not based upon the fact that many of the frauds are perpetrated for motives of greed rather than need. Both types of fraud are widespread. They are equally difficult to detect. If the fraud is based upon a perceived need, a custodial sentence must be expected except in very special circumstances. If the fraud is based on greed, the custodial sentence will be longer. See <em>Regina v David Fernanda Medina </em>(at 6); <em>Regina v Mears </em>(at 145).”<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In much the same way, in <em>R v Milne</em>[20], which involved the fraudulent receipt of social security payments over a period of more than 18 years totalling more than $170,000, this court held to be manifestly inadequate a wholly suspended sentence of nine months and increased the sentence to a total effective sentence of two years of which the first six months were to be served in prison. Winneke P analysed the relevant considerations in these terms: <br />“12. In circumstances where extensive frauds on the welfare system have been perpetrated over a long period, a significant purpose of punishment must, in my view, be general deterrence. Such purpose of punishment will ordinarily be influential both in the fixing of appropriate sentences for the crimes committed and in fixing a point at which the prisoner is to be eligible for release. Although, as has been pointed out on behalf of the respondent, there were powerful factors to be taken into account on her behalf in mitigation of punishment - particularly her otherwise good character, her pleas of guilty, her physical health and the fact that she had made restitution - I am nevertheless driven to the conclusion, from the nature of the sentences imposed, that her Honour has given far too little weight to the notion that a strong message must be sent to members of the community, who are minded to engage in systematic cheating of the welfare system of the type in which the respondent has engaged, that such conduct will not be tolerated by the courts. This Court has tried to get this message across in many cases of long-running and substantial frauds on the revenue, which have frequently been misdescribed as “victimless crimes”. For my own part, it seems to me that the sentences imposed by her Honour - particularly those imposed on counts 3, 4 and 5 - wholly fail to incorporate that message, and accord disproportionate weight to the matters urged in mitigation...”<br />Then after referring to the considerations which the trial judge had treated as being sufficiently exceptional to suspend the sentence, Winneke P continued:<br />“13. ... I do not intend to suggest that in every case where a person has fraudulently obtained benefits for extensive periods and has done so in the absence of pressing need, that the court imposing sentence is inevitably to regard principles of deterrence as of paramount importance in the sense that actual imprisonment must be ordered. What I do suggest, however, is that ordinarily in such cases, that will be so. In speaking of sustained and deliberate social security frauds over lengthy period, King, C.J. said - in <em>R v Cameron &amp; Anor. </em>- that the deterrent purpose of punishment must be paramount. His Honour said (at p307) that: <br />... the courts have a great responsibility to protect the integrity of the social security system by imposing punishments for deliberate and sustained fraud which are likely to operate as a deterrent to others who may be tempted ... . It is necessary for the courts to send, and consistently send, a clear signal to all who might be so tempted, that sustained and deliberate fraud upon the system will mean going to gaol.<br />In the subsequent case of <em>Kovacevic</em>, the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal, sitting as a court of five judges, reviewed the remarks made by King CJ in Cameron’s case. The majority said[21] that they could not fully subscribe to one aspect of what King CJ had said — namely that, in all cases of sustained and deliberate fraud, general deterrence must be paramount. Rather, so the majority said that in cases of sustained and deliberate fraud, deterrence must loom large in determining the appropriate sentence. But other matters, specially rehabilitation, must be considered. The majority concluded:<br />In our opinion the proper approach to sentencing is better reflected by saying that, in a case of the type referred to by King CJ, an order for imprisonment, with at least some of the imprisonment actually to be served is ordinarily likely to be required. <br />As I have said, I agree with these remarks. An actual sentence of imprisonment is ordinarily likely to be required in cases of sustained and deliberate cheating of the social welfare system because it is unlikely that mitigating factors will be of sufficient significance to outweigh the primary purpose for imposing sentence in such cases, namely general deterrence. But that is not to say that there will not be the exceptional case where such factors exist. However, here, the factors do not seem to me to be exceptional.”<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Views may differ as to whether the “rule” or “practice” rises any higher than the application of general sentencing principles to the particular considerations which apply in cases of tax and welfare fraud. I think that that is the preferable way of looking at it. As Hunt CJ at CL said, the rationale of the “rule” is that social security fraud is easy to commit and widespread but difficult to detect, and that the introduction of more checks upon applicants for social security would cause delays in the payment of benefits and therefore hardship to those whose need is urgent, as well as the need to protect the revenue. More or less the same may be said of the observations of Higgins J about tax evasion. In terms of sentencing principle therefore, the point is that general deterrence is of particular significance in cases of tax and welfare fraud. But the practical result or consequence is that a custodial sentence will be necessary unless the particular circumstances are sufficiently exceptional. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;I am also inclined to doubt that the “rule” is applicable to the facts of this case. This was not a case of social security fraud in the usual sense. By and large the applicant was not in it for himself. And as Eames JA observed in the course of argument, there is nothing before us which suggests that the sort of offences committed by the applicant are widespread or difficult to detect, or that audit or other appropriate safeguards against repetition of such offences would slow down the delivery of social security payments. No doubt fraud of the kind committed by the applicant is just as much a drain on the revenue as would be fraud by the recipients of the payments. Whether the fraud is organised by the recipient or a welfare officer really makes no difference to the cost. But unless offences of the kind committed by the applicant are prevalent, the effect on the revenue may not be great in relative terms. In the absence of evidence of particular prevalence,[22] it is difficult to see why fraud of the kind committed by the applicant should be approached any differently to fraud committed by any other trusted employee on any other employer. Indeed, as Mr Croucher submitted, the general principle of parity in sentencing implies that it should not be.[23] <br /><strong>The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate<br />28.</strong>&nbsp;Be that as it may, I consider that the sentence imposed on Count 1 was manifestly inadequate. With all respect to the learned and very experienced sentencing judge, and despite what was said by the majority in <em>Trainor and Cahir</em>, I am unable to accept that a wholly suspended term of imprisonment of only nine months is near to adequate penalty for a fraud by a trusted operative involving almost $90,000 perpetrated over a period of two years. Regardless of whether the “rule” applies to this case, the respondent’s offences were “serious”. He systematically defrauded the Commonwealth of more than $90,000 over a period of more than two years in flagrant breach of the duties of trust and loyalty which he owed to the Commonwealth as his employer. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;It is true that he may not have profited to any great extent. But in the circumstances of this case I do not think that to be particularly significant. He was not a social security claimant pressed by the exigencies of a wretched existence to seek more than his legal entitlement. Nor was he facing serious financial difficulties or insecure in his employment or fearful of the loss of allowances or suffering from ill health or a disadvantaged background. Nor was he like the taxpayer in Carter who was in such straightened financial circumstances that he succumbed to the temptation of “deferring” the payment of tax in order to keep his business afloat. The respondent was employed in a secure and relatively well paid position, as a servant of the Commonwealth, whose appointed function and duty was to ensure that benefits went to claimants who were entitled to receive them and that benefits did not go to those who were not entitled to them. <br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;I am also unimpressed by the contention that he acted altruistically out of a misplaced sense of wishing to help the disadvantaged. It is altogether too easy to be generous at the expense of an employer and then claim that no vice attaches; and for the respondent to procure the payment of benefits to persons whom he knew not to be entitled to receive them was to procure the very thing that he was entrusted to guard against. That means that he acted in breach of the trust that he knew that the Commonwealth placed in him, and that implies a high degree of culpability compared to the sorts of offenders that warrant merciful sentences. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;The judge below referred to all of the matters that might be thought to bear upon the sentence to be imposed. Evidently, his Honour gave careful consideration to the factors put forward as mitigating circumstances and he referred to the relevant sentencing principles and principal relevant authorities. I acknowledge with respect that I am unable to detect any specific error apparent in his Honour’s sentencing remarks. I am also acutely conscious of the principle that it is only in very clear and rare cases of manifest inadequacy or error that a Director’s appeal should be allowed.[24] Obviously, it is not enough to take a different view as to the way in which the sentencing discretion might have been exercised. Nor is there warrant to intervene if the sentence which might be imposed upon re-sentencing would be limited by the principle of double jeopardy to a sentence close to the original sentence.[25<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;In the scheme of things there may not be many cases in which it is properly open to a judge to impose a sentence of imprisonment so short that it can be suspended and yet in which the suspension of the sentence will render the sentence manifestly inadequate. Ordinarily, the propriety of so short a short sentence will imply that a suspended sentence is within the available sentencing range. This case is one of the exceptions. The point has already been made that those who commit serious frauds against the revenue should be punished with custodial sentences and such sentences should include a period actually to be served. To that may be added that the deterrent and punitive effects of the sentence should not be unduly diminished by allowing release from custody and an unduly early stage.[26] And whether or not the “rule” applies in this case, the result is much the same. Despite the factors which the learned judge took into account as mitigating circumstances, and his Honour’s careful attention to ss16A and 20(1)(a) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1914, I consider that his Honour erred in not requiring the respondent to serve at least part of the nine months imprisonment before being released. <br /><strong>Double jeopardy and delay<br />33.</strong>&nbsp;That having been said, it is impossible to escape the limitations inherent in a Crown appeal and which result from the fact that there has been considerable delay on the part of the Commonwealth (for which the respondent was not responsible) in prosecuting the matter to trial. As has already been noticed, the respondent was first interviewed in October 2000 and in broad terms he admitted the offences at that time. Once the principle of double jeopardy is brought to bear upon the small difference[27] between wholly and partially suspended sentences of only nine months’ imprisonment, and bearing in mind the delay, I consider that it would be inappropriate for this court to intervene. <br /><strong>Conclusion <br />34.</strong>&nbsp;Consequently, and despite that the sentence imposed was in my opinion manifestly inadequate, I would dismiss the appeal. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213. <br />[2] I enter this caveat: if it proves that Robin Hoods are widespread in the social security system, such leniency may not be available in future. It may have to give way to the requirements of general deterrence. <br />[3] The principle of sentencing as a last resort is also enshrined in ss5(3) and 5(4) of the <em>Sentencing Act </em>1991. Whether s5(4) is directed to the choice between imposing a suspended and an unsuspended sentence has been doubted (see <em>R v Haddara </em>(1997) 95 A Crim R 108, at 111, per Callaway JA) but, in my view, the principle of imprisonment as a last resort is an appropriate one to adopt by sentencing judges irrespective of any statutory mandate, and would appropriately be applied when considering whether to impose a term of actual imprisonment and partial suspension, on the one hand, or total suspension of a sentence of imprisonment, on the other hand (or, in the case of a Commonwealth offence whether to release the offender immediately on a recognisance release order). <br />[4] See <em>DPP v Johnstone </em>[2004] VSCA 150, at [27]. <br />[5] See <em>R v Clarke </em>[1996] 2 VR 520 at 522. <br />[6] Johnstone, at [28]. <br />[7] Formerly, the Department of Social Security. <br />[8] (1993) 42 FCR 512 at 519. <br />[9] NSWCCA 27 March 1997, BC 9700950. <br />[10] [2001] VSCA 93. <br />[11] [2000] VSCA 249. <br />[12] He referred in particular to the observations of Kirby J in <em>Dinsdale v The Queen </em>(2000) 202 CLR 321 at 343 [68]-[69] and the remarks of King CJ in <em>R v Osenkowski </em>(1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213. <br />[13] <em>Dinsdale v The Queen </em>(2000) 202 CLR 321 at 329 [18] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. <br />[14] [1998] 1 VR 601 at 606 . <br />[15] Fox &amp; Frieberg, <em>Sentencing, State and Federal Law in Victoria</em>, 2nd Ed. at [12.1008]. <br />[16] <em>R v Kopievsky</em>, Vic.

Charge 11 read as follows: </p>\r\n<p>Between 27 March 2003 and 9 April 2003 the defendant posted a document being an advertisement for “Steve Bedwell” at 290 La Trobe Street, Melbourne without the consent of the owner [or] occupier of the premises or of any other person or body having authority to give such consent.<br />Summary Offences Act 1966 section 10(1)</p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;Charge 5 arose out of the same facts, but was brought under section 45O of the Environment Protection Act 1970 (“the EPA”). </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The evidence of the respondent, who was the informant in the matter, was that on 9 April 2003 she observed posters on the building at 290 Latrobe Street. She was unable to say when the posters were placed on the wall. She identified photographs of the posters which she saw. The transcript does not at that point identify the content of the posters. However, it becomes apparent later that one at least of them was an advertisement for “Steve Bedwell”, and nothing turns on this. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The other witness was Mr McNeany, marketing manager of the Mercury Lounge where the Steve Bedwell concert the subject of the posters was held. He gave evidence that the art work for the posters was sent to Rock Posters, who have for many years printed and organised the distribution of posters for events at the Mercury Lounge. He said that the performance by Steve Bedwell was from 28th March to 9th April and they would expect the posters to be distributed anything from one to two weeks before the show began. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;The appellant called no evidence. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;The transcript of the Magistrate’s reasons relevantly reads: </p>\r\n<p>Charge 5 is a charge under section 45O in the [EPA] and that section requires evidence of a date of affixing, in my view. Mr McNeany gave evidence that it was possible that this was affixed prior to the 27th of March and therefore clearly not within the between dates specified in the charge that is the 27th of March and the 9th of April, 2003 and Miss Bugeja observed the poster on the building, that being so it is possible on his evidence that could have been up to two weeks before and no later than a day before in the usual course of the matter. I’m therefore not satisfied in relation to the date of the charge being correctly specified beyond reasonable doubt and that charge will be dismissed.<br />. . .<br />Charge 11. The submission of [counsel for Rock Posters] was in relation to charge 11 that there was no evidence of the affixing of the bill. My view is that the deeming provisions of section 10(2) apply on the evidence of Mr McNeany and supports to my satisfaction the requirements of section 10(2), that the inference that the defendant was in anyway concerned in the promotion, management or management of any business and so on as set out in the section. If I am so satisfied the onus is then on the defendant to prove to the contrary. The defendant has called no evidence in relation to that matter and therefore has not satisfied the evidentiary onus that’s placed on it.</p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;Counsel subsequently drew attention to the different treatment of the date issue between charges 5 and 11 and the Magistrate’s reply relevantly reads: </p>\r\n<p>. . . in relation to that matter the view I take is this, that the authority is a continuing authority in relation to the matter. And whilst that criticism is warranted in relation to the other charges, I don’t think it is in relation to this. I think the evidence that Mr McNeany showed, that they were still authorised and I think that in those circumstances the charge is still proven.</p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;It would seem that the Magistrate can be taken as having found: </p>\r\n<p>(i) that it was possible that the poster had been affixed up to two weeks before the commencement of the period set out in the charge and accordingly that he could not find beyond reasonable doubt that the posting of the bill occurred within that period;<br />(ii) that the provision of the EPA under which charge 5 was brought required such a finding;<br />(iii) accordingly that charge 5 must fail;<br />(iv) that Rock Posters was, on the evidence of Mr McNeany authorised to distribute posters for it, i.e. to publish them, and that that authorisation was a continuing authorisation;<br />(v) that Rock Posters was concerned in the promotion of the entertainment referred to in the poster by virtue of being authorised to distribute the posters as part of that promotion;<br />(v) that Rock Posters had called no evidence to satisfy the court that it did not post or authorise the posting of the poster;<br />(vi) accordingly that the deeming provision in paragraph 10(2)(b) operated, so that Rock Posters was deemed to have posted the bill and there was no implication that the posting occurred on any particular date;<br />(vii) accordingly that (i) above did not operate to cause charge 11 to fail.</p>\r\n<p>Question (a)<br />14.&nbsp;Mr Nicholson, for Rock Posters, submitted that the offence created by section 10 was complete on the posting of the bill on the building. If the actual date of posting could not be proved, or was found to precede the date charged, the offence could not be made out. The deeming provision in section 10(2)(b) did not affect that position. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Section 27 of the Magistrates’ Court Act deals with descriptions in a charge, but makes no reference to the inclusion or description of a date or time period. Given the jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Court in criminal proceedings, appearing in section 25 of that Act, section 27 must be taken to deal with summary offences and indictable offences triable summarily. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;As to indictable offences, section 375 of the Crimes Act 1958 provides: </p>\r\n<p>Omission of certain details not fatal to presentment etc.<br />No indictment or presentment shall be held insufficient for omitting to state the time at which an offence was committed in any case where time is not of the essence of the offence; nor for stating the time imperfectly; nor for stating the offence to have been committed on a day subsequent to the finding of the indictment or presentment or on an impossible day or on a day that never happened.</p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Neither of these provisions is of assistance. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;Ms Porritt, for the respondent, relied on the Victorian case of R v Tieman,[1] in which the Full Court (Madden CJ, a’Beckett and Cussen JJ) found the case before them not to be an exception to “the general rule which makes the assignment of a wrong date for an offence an immaterial circumstance” and on the decision of the English Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dossi[2] in which Atkin J said:<br />&nbsp;<br />From time immemorial a date specified in an indictment has never been a material matter unless it is actually an essential part of the alleged offence. . . . Thus, though the date of the offence should be alleged in the indictment, it has never been necessary that it should be laid according to truth unless time is of the essence of the offence. It follows, therefore, that the jury were entitled, if there was evidence on which they could come to that conclusion, to find the appellant guilty of the offence charged against him, even though they found that it had not been committed on the actual date specified in the indictment.</p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;The question thus is whether time is of the essence of an offence under sub-section 10(1). In my view the effect of the deeming provision in paragraph 10(2)(b) must be that a person may be found guilty of the offence on the basis of findings of fact which are not directly related to the time at which the bill was posted. That being so, it may be said that prima facie time is not of the essence of an offence under that section. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;However, section 26(4) of the Magistrates’ Court Act provides: </p>\r\n<p>(4) a proceeding for a summary offence must be commenced not later than 12 months after the date on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, except where otherwise provided by or under any other Act.</p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;In Hackwill v Kay[3] the Full Court (O’Bryan, Dean and Monahan JJ) held that where there is a time limit within which an information for an offence must be laid, the date of the alleged offence is an essential part of the information. The Court said, after referring to Dossi and Tieman: </p>\r\n<p>The question, however, remains whether in this case the date was an essential part of the offence. Here the statute provides that an information for this offence “shall be laid within 12 months from the time when the matter of such information arose and not afterwards”. [Emphasis in the original.] The date of the alleged offence is therefore a most material matter and is, in our opinion, part of the essence of the offence. This is supported by note (q) to paragraph 702 of Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 10 pp. 387-8, where the learned authors of the article on “Criminal Law and Procedure” state four cases in which they say time is of the essence of the offence and therefore must be inserted and truly stated in the indictment. The fourth case is “when the prosecution for a particular crime must be commenced within a certain time of the commission of the alleged criminal act”. The list of contributors to that article contains names very distinguished in the criminal law. In our opinion, that passage is in accordance with principle and with common sense and we accept it as a correct statement of the law.</p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;Ms Porritt sought to distinguish Hackwill v Kay on the facts, but the broad statement of principle enunciated by the Full Court is clear and inescapable. The decision was followed by Nathan J in Kerr v Hannon.[4] </p>\r\n<p><br />23.&nbsp;The answer to question (a) is accordingly No. That finding is sufficient to dispose of this matter, and it is accordingly not necessary to consider questions (b) and (c). </p>\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />24.&nbsp;The appeal will be allowed. Counsel may wish to make submissions as to the form of the orders and as to costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] [1908] VLR 4 at 8 <br />[2] (1918) 13 Cr App R 158 at 159-60 <br />[3] [1960] VR 632 at 634 <br />[4] [1992] 1 VR 43.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the Appellant Rock Posters Pty Ltd: Mr A Nicholson, counsel.

Accordingly, the court was not in error in finding the charge proved.<br />&nbsp;Matthews v Fountain [1982] VR 1045, affirmed.</p>\r\n<p>VINCENT JA:<br />1.&nbsp;I will invite Nettle JA to deliver the first judgment in this matter. </p>\r\n<p>NETTLE JA: <br />2.&nbsp;This is an application for leave to appeal against conviction on one count of obtaining financial advantage by deception contrary to s82 of the Crimes Act 1958. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;At relevant times the applicant was a self employed plasterer. In June 2000 he established a credit account with a plasterboard supplier called Itizideal Pty Ltd and between 13 June 2000 and 21 July 2000 he made fifteen purchases of plasterboard and associated products on credit at prices totalling $32,701.23. Early in August 2000 the manager of Itizideal Pty Ltd, Mr Ian Williams, made a number of telephone calls to the applicant seeking payment of the account. The applicant was financially embarrassed and he attempted to play for time. Eventually, however, he told Mr Williams that he would leave a cheque in his letter box for Mr Williams to collect. On 8 August 2000 Mr Williams collected the cheque from the letterbox as agreed. It was drawn on National Australia Bank account No. 67506 7430 in the name of “DV Plastering, D. Vasic, T/A” payable to Itizideal Pty Ltd in the amount of $32,701.23. But it was dishonoured on presentation for payment. Account No. 67506 7430 had been closed some years before. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;On 15 August 2000 Mr Williams had the applicant sign a document in which he acknowledged that the debt was due, and admitted that he had offered the dishonoured cheque knowing that the bank account had been closed, and he also undertook to pay part of the amount owing by 18 August 2000 with the remainder to be paid by 31 August 2000. But the applicant did not honour the terms of that undertaking or otherwise pay the debt, and the police were later informed. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;On 18 August 2003 the applicant was arraigned before Judge Davey in the County Court at Melbourne on the one count of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by the deferment of a debt[1] by deception by falsely representing that the cheque was a good and valid order for the payment of $32,701.23. He pleaded not guilty and following the presentation of the Crown case his counsel submitted that there was no case to answer. That submission was based on the judgment of Miles CJ of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory in Fisher v Bennett[2] that the mere presentation of valueless cheque in satisfaction of an antecedent financial obligation does not without more constitute the obtaining of a financial advantage within the meaning of s78C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).[3] Judge Davey rejected the submission and held that there was a case to answer. The applicant thereupon pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to undergo a Community Based Order of six months duration. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;The applicant now contends that Judge Davey was wrong in law in holding that there was a case to answer. </p>\r\n<p>The decision below<br />7.&nbsp;In his reasons for ruling, Judge Davey said: </p>\r\n<p>“Mr Danos submitted that an element of the offence was not made out. He submitted that although there was evidence of dishonesty in his client’s conduct and of deception there was no evidence on which a jury, properly instructed, could find that the accused had obtained a financial advantage. In support of his submission he relied upon two decisions...[R v Locker[4] and Fisher v Bennett[5]]... The Victorian legislation is very different from the English Act and I must say, after having considered [R v Locker], I have not found it of any assistance to me. The second decision [Fisher v Bennett] ... was an appeal against conviction in the Canberra Magistrates’ Court. The legislation there is in very similar terms to the Victorian Act. In that case [Miles CJ] concluded that in the absence of evidence that the appellant’s position was improved by the giving of the valueless cheque to the creditor, the prosecution failed. With the greatest respect to [Miles CJ], I do not think that the law as it appears applied in the ACT is the law in this State. In the case of Matthews v Fountain[6] Gray J considered the operation and effect of s82(1) of the Crimes Act. He held, as the headnote states: ''A person who knowingly proffers a valueless cheque in purport[ed] discharge of an antecedent debt obtains a financial advantage within the meaning of s82 of the Crimes Act 1958.'' He went on to say that it did not matter that the person who knowingly proffers a valueless cheque is penniless... Justice Gray’s decision was briefly considered in the Court of [Criminal] Appeal in the case of John Richard Walsh[7]. O’Bryan J in delivering the first judgment referred to the judgment of Gray J in Matthews v Fountain and stated: `The concept of financial advantage is a simple one. It is expressed by the use of two common words, each of clear meaning’ and then went on to say - and I might say he was there quoting from the judgment of Gray, J.: “I agree that the words should be given their plain meaning and that no narrow construction should be given to them” and then went on to say, and [in so doing] in my view expressed a contrary view to the opinion of Miles CJ: ''It is not to the point that the applicant might have obtained a financial advantage from the errant bank in New York. The critical question indeed an essential element of the charge laid is whether the applicant attempted to obtain a financial advantage from Westpac by his conduct.''[8] On the present facts in my view it is clear that the accused attempted to gain a financial advantage and did in my view obtain a financial advantage in the wide sense in which the term has been interpreted in both the Mathews decision and the Walsh decision. At the very least the financial advantage was the giving to the accused of further time in which to find another source of finance. In the present circumstances there is, in my view, evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find the accused guilty of the offence.”</p>\r\n<p>The concept of financial advantage <br />8.&nbsp;In my opinion Judge Davey was right. Much of what was said by Miles CJ in Fisher v Bennett was based on questions posed by Professor David Lanham in his 1977 article on the meaning of financial advantage.[9] They in turn were based upon the rhetorical question posed by Lord Widgery CJ in R v Turner[10] as to how it can be said that a penniless man owing a debt which he has no prospect of being able to pay evades the debt by giving the creditor a worthless cheque in pretended payment of it. Miles CJ embraced the question, and the answer which it may be supposed that Lord Widgery might have given to it, as follows: </p>\r\n<p>“The reference to the financial position of the defendant [in Matthews v Fountain] relates to the hypothetical example of the ''penniless man'' mentioned initially by Lord Widgery CJ when Turner’s case was before the Court of Criminal Appeal at [1973] 2 All ER 828 and by Lord Reid in the House of Lords in the passage referred to above. That concept is discussed in an article in (1977) 1 Crim LJ 188. In that article the author, Professor Lanham, discusses the example of a person [scil. a penniless man] who incurs a debt perfectly honestly but practises deception at a later stage in order to obtain relief from the creditor’s claim. On p193 the author observes that in a case of what he calls ''unilateral evasion'' the deceitful debtor gains nothing which he could not have obtained by outright refusal to pay or by keeping out of the creditor’s way, and that where the debtor passes a valueless cheque, it is hard to see what financial advantage is obtained. The example of unilateral evasion is contrasted by the author with the situation where by deception the debtor secures the agreement of the creditor to reduce or forgive the debt. I think that there is force in the authors remarks.”</p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;With respect, however, Gray J explained in Matthews v Fountain[11] why Lord Widgery’s conception of the penniless man should be avoided for the purposes of s82 of the Crimes Act. As Gray J said: </p>\r\n<p>“...the proposition put forward by Lord Widgery presents considerable difficulty. It is difficult to imagine a factual situation in which a creditor is offered cash but is induced by deception to take a valueless cheque. What is a ''penniless person'' for this purpose? Is he a man who cannot conveniently pay the debt or one who cannot beg, borrow or steal the amount required? It is difficult to imagine a man in such depleted circumstances that he derives no financial advantage from the evasion of a debt. It is clear enough that the appellant was not, on the facts stated, a ''penniless person'' in any sense. All that the facts show is that he had no funds in a particular bank account at a particular time. ... </p>\r\n<p>The difficulties which would flow from the adoption of Lord Widgery’s formulation are touched upon in an interesting article by David Lanham, Obtaining a Financial Advantage by Deception in Victoria, [1977] 1 Crim LJ 188. ...The writer points out that if ''pennilessness'' is available as a defence, the court would become involved in an investigation of the defendant’s financial position. If he takes the defence of an intention not to pay in any event, that issue would have to be investigated. As already stated, I do not consider that these problems arise. In the commonplace situation of a debtor giving a valueless cheque to gain some time from his pursuers the debtor does, in my opinion, obtain a ''financial advantage'' within the meaning of s82”.</p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;It may also be observed in passing that the suggested “penniless man” exception to obtaining financial advantage by deception is as flawed as a matter of economic theory as it is intractable in practice. Evidently, the idea of the exception depends upon the premise that there is no advantage to a debtor in deferring payment of a debt unless the debtor has the money or the means of obtaining the money with which to pay the debt. According to that conception of things, if a debtor has the money or the means of obtaining it, the delay affords him or her a financial advantage equal to the time value of the debt for the period of the delay; in other words, the return which the money would generate in that period or the cost of borrowing the money for that period. Conversely, if the debtor has no money and no means of obtaining it, the delay affords him nothing; for without money he has no means of obtaining a return on money and if he cannot borrow money he cannot be said to have avoided the costs of borrowing it. But as a matter of economic theory a debtor can always borrow money. In theory it is all just a matter of price, and so everyone can borrow – at a price – no matter what the level of their credit risk. As the economist would have it, the price elasticity of credit may be hyperbolically sensitive to borrower security, but the gradient of that function never reaches infinity. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;And so it is too in reality. For in reality, in the society in which we live, there are no penniless men. Widespread and deep though poverty may be in some sections of our society, all men in it have some money or at least the ability to obtain some money, by work or by the realisation of assets or by borrowing, even at exorbitant rates, or perhaps even in the form of social security entitlements. To that extent, all men obtain a financial advantage by deferring the payment of a debt; no matter how poor they may be. They are relieved of a claim upon such money or ability to generate it as they may have, for the period of the deferral. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;In the article by Professor Lanham already mentioned, reference is made[12] to an example (cited by the Criminal Law Revision Committee) of a woman who obtains forbearance by telling a debt collector falsely that her husband is off work sick. The Committee considered that the ordinary man or woman would be surprised to be told that conduct of that kind was criminal and not merely discreditable. Maybe that is so. But as at present advised I am not prepared to exclude the possibility of its criminality. It is one thing to be without the money with which to meet an obligation. Obviously, there is no offence in a debtor responding to a debt collector in those circumstances that he or she is unable to pay the debt. Furthermore, if that is the truth of the matter, and it is that fact alone which causes the creditor to give time, there is nothing necessarily criminal in the debtor embroidering the facts with a story or two as to how the debtor’s state of financial embarrassment came about. But it may well be otherwise if the debtor has the money and says that he or she does not have it or, even if the debtor does not have it immediately available, he or she buys time by telling a false story as to how that situation came about. I am inclined to think that most ordinary men and women would agree that the latter as not only dishonest but possibly also fraudulent.[13] </p>\r\n<p>Section 82 of the Crimes Act<br />13.&nbsp;Fortunately, the problem here is not as difficult. We are concerned only with the question of whether it is an offence under s82 of the Crimes Act 1958 for a debtor to defer the payment of a debt by giving his creditor a cheque, which the debtor knows to be worthless, in pretended payment of the debt. In my opinion that question should be answered affirmatively, just as it was by Gray J in Matthews v Fountain. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;Section 82 of the Crimes Act was designedly based on s16 of the Theft Act 1968 (UK), on the recommendation of the Chief Justice Law Reform Committee, with the intention that it apply to cases of common fraud involving the dishonest obtaining of credit or services[14]. As it was put in the explanatory memorandum:[15] </p>\r\n<p>“[The Chief Justice’s Law Reform Committee] decided to recommend the enactment of the English statute with some minor modifications; a few of these modifications relate to matters of basic principle, but most of them are needed to take account either of the relationship between federal and state spheres of legislative authority or of the general pattern of Victoria legislation. Its decision was based on the fact that the English reform has proved highly successful in practice. The English courts have shown a determination to interpret the new provisions according to their letter and spirit, and to discourage attempts to introduce into new law the technicalities that disfigured the old. Their decisions will be readily available as precedents and guidance for our own courts. ... Section 82 creates a new offence of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. It is needed because certain types of common fraud, involving a dishonest obtaining of another’s services (for example, without any intention of paying for them), are not covered by the offence of theft (section 72) or criminal deception (section 81); since no ''property'' is obtained, neither of those sections is available. It was thought undesirable, because of possible unfortunate repercussions, to deal with the problem by defining ''property'' so as to include services.”</p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Section 82 was, however, also made different to s16 of the Theft Act in two respects, so as to overcome problems that had been found in England to result from a proscription in s16(1) which spoke in terms of obtaining a “pecuniary advantage” and an exhaustive definition of that expression in s16(2).[16] The matter was explained in detail in the Committee’s Report[17] and in the explanatory memorandum, as follows: </p>\r\n<p>“The present section [scil. s82] differs, however, in two respects from its English counterpart [s16]. The English Act uses the phrase ''pecuniary advantage'', and provides a definition for the phrase. This definition is unhappily worded, and has given rise to a set of technicalities described recently by an eminent English judge as a ''judicial nightmare''.[18] It is thought that the proposed section 82 will remove these difficulties. Sub-section (1) defines the offence as dishonestly obtaining by deception a ''financial advantage''. This phrase is thought more apt to describe what is meant than is the phrase ''pecuniary advantage'' used in the English Act; and in order to avoid a repercussion in Victoria of the ''judicial nightmare'' no attempt is made to define it. The offence is, in common with all other analogous offences under the Act, declared to be felony. It carries a maximum penalty of 5 years. Sub-section (2) applies the definition of ''deception'' in section 81 to his offence.”</p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;Thus as I read the Committee’s report and the explanatory memorandum,[19] “financial advantage” was thought to be a broader notion than “pecuniary advantage”, and so to cover at least all of those things embraced in the extended definition of “pecuniary advantage” in s16(2) of the Theft Act, and an exhaustive definition of the kind contained in s16(2) was eschewed lest it be taken to limit ordinary conceptions of financial advantage. If that be so, it can scarcely be doubted that s82 was intended to have an operation as broad as s16 of the Theft Act, if indeed not broader.[20] </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;At least, in as much as s82 was enacted in the belief that “the English reform [had] proved highly successful in practice”, and with evident approval of the way in which “the English courts [had] shown a determination to interpret the new provisions according to their letter and spirit, and to discourage attempts to introduce into the new law the technicalities that disfigured the old” and in the hope that the English decisions would “be readily available as precedents and guidance for our own courts”, I conclude[21] it was intended that the decisions of the House of Lords in Turner’s case and DPP v Ray[22] should apply as much to s82 as they do to s16 of the Theft Act. </p>\r\n<p>The evidence<br />18.&nbsp;What I have said so far assumes that it would have made a difference in this case if the judge had been in error in following the observations of Gray J in Matthews v Fountain in preference to the judgment of Miles CJ in Fisher v Bennett. In fact it would not. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;In his record of interview (which was tendered as part of the Crown case) the applicant admitted that he was carrying on business as a plasterer and had a number of jobs running and that he had to pay men to keep working on those jobs and purchase supplies. He also admitted that it was in that state of affairs that he passed the valueless cheque, in order to buy time, relieve pressure, and generate the money with which to pay and ultimately to continue to trade with Itizideal Pty Ltd.[23] It follows that even if the law were that a so-called penniless man is incapable of obtaining a financial advantage by passing a false cheque, it would not have availed the applicant. For on the evidence before the judge, the applicant was not a penniless man and he clearly did obtain a financial advantage by passing the valueless cheque. </p>\r\n<p>The plea of guilty<br />20.&nbsp;As has already been noted, the conviction was entered upon a plea of guilty following the dismissal of the applicant’s no case submission. Ordinarily that would raise a question as to the competence of the application. A plea of guilty once entered constitutes an admission as to each element of the offence[24] and, consequently, an application for leave to appeal against conviction entered on a plea of guilty is seldom entertained unless the applicant did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to admit he was guilty of it or if upon the admitted facts he could not in law have been convicted of it or unless for some other reason the court is satisfied that a miscarriage of justice would or might occur if the accused is held to his plea.[25] In this case it is said that it would be a miscarriage of justice to hold the applicant to his plea because it was entered only after the no case submission was decided adversely to the applicant and only because the applicant was for the purposes of the trial forced to accept that the law was as the judge had determined it to be. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;I am aware that such a view of the matter may appeal to other members of the court. But with respect I wish to say for my own part that I think it at least to be arguable that the applicant went further by his plea of guilty than simply admitting that he was bound to be convicted upon the law as determined by the judge. Since a plea of guilty is an admission of each of the elements of the offence, why should not the applicant be thought to have admitted all the facts necessary to show that he had dishonestly obtained a financial advantage by passing the valueless cheque? He had the choice of standing mute and attacking the ruling on appeal. And he could have done that without making any admissions of fact. He chose instead to plead, and no doubt he did that in order to obtain such advantage upon sentencing as a plea of guilty entails. In that sense his position is little different to an accused who having failed in a no case submission goes into evidence and is then convicted on all of the evidence.[26] In cases of that kind it is not regarded as unfair that an applicant may have been led by judicial error to expose himself to a determination that he is guilty. In point of principle it is not immediately apparent to me why it should be thought to be different here. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;We were nevertheless referred to the decision of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Cheng[27] where it was said that an appeal against conviction upon the ground that a demurrer was wrongly overruled was competent notwithstanding a plea of guilty entered after the demurrer had been overruled and in the knowledge that the ruling on the demurrer was inevitable and an appeal almost certain.[28] Mr McArdle for the Crown submitted that it would not be inappropriate for this Court to follow a similar approach, upon the basis that the applicant had by his plea admitted no more than that if the law were as determined by Judge Davey he was liable to be convicted. In the circumstances I am prepared to follow that course. </p>\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />23.&nbsp;In the event I would dismiss the application. </p>\r\n<p>VINCENT JA: <br />24.&nbsp;I also agree that this application for leave to appeal against conviction should be dismissed, and I do so essentially for the reasons advanced by Nettle JA. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;However, I would add that it is not, I consider, necessary to express any view as to the proper answers to a number of the difficult questions, posed by his Honour in his judgment, concerning the concept of financial advantage encompassed by s82 of the Crimes Act. Those questions simply do not arise for consideration in this case, although I would also add that I am of the opinion that the approach adopted by him is almost certainly correct. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;I would finally add that, in a situation in which an accused person enters a plea of guilty, having accepted a ruling of law from the trial judge that his proposed defence would avail him nothing, the fact that the individual has acted on that basis would constitute exceptional circumstances justifying this Court not holding him to his plea of guilty. </p>\r\n<p>CUMMINS AJ A: <br />27.&nbsp;I agree with the disposition of this matter proposed by Nettle JA and, save in one respect, I agree with what Nettle JA has stated as the reasons for that disposition. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;In relation to the corollaries of the plea of guilty, I consider it would be unfair to hold against an accused person in circumstances such as here a plea of guilty. On the contrary, I think it is to the credit of his counsel, Mr Danos, and to the credit differentially of the accused, that in their respective capacities they accepted the consequences of the ruling of the trial judge. It was the trial judge who determined the law in the case. Mr Danos having made the submission and it having failed, it is to the credit of counsel and of the accused that the accused then complied with the direction of law, rather than spend more time and function of the administration of justice pursuing a right merely for future purposes. Accordingly, with every respect, I have a different view from Nettle JA on that point alone. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;However, I do wish to add one brief word on the procedure where, as here, during a trial, an accused pleads guilty. In this case the accused had been arraigned on the count of obtaining financial advantage by deception on the morning of Monday 18 August 2003 and the trial proceeded throughout the day. At 3 p.m. the prosecution case concluded and the prosecutor announced in the presence of the jury that the prosecution case had concluded. Mr Danos in the presence of the jury then said that there was a matter of law he wished to raise, and the learned judge said to the jury that, “Frequently at these trials matters arise where there are issues of law which are discussed in the absence of the jury, and this is such a matter.” He sent the jury away until the next day. Submissions were heard by the judge from Mr Danos and counsel for the prosecution late on the Monday. Then on the next morning the learned judge gave his ruling on the matter. The judge having ruled as he did, at 10.45 am the jury was brought in and immediately, in the presence of the jury, the accused was re-arraigned on the original count and pleaded guilty to it. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;His Honour treated the jury with courtesy, twice thanking them in generous terms. However, with every respect, I consider that his Honour failed to inform the jury of the nature and incidents of the process which was then occurring. The jury were given no direction of law or information as to what was occurring, other than being invited to consider their verdict and being informed by the judge that there was only one verdict they could bring in. There is no need for lengthy directions or explanations from a judge to a jury in such circumstances, but in my view certain minimum direction is required. I would regard that as then involving, first, direction to the jury, which doubtless the judge had given at the start of the case anyway, of the differing functions between judge and jury. Second, a direction of law by the judge to the jury that a plea of guilty by an accused person involves in law an admission to each of the necessary elements of the crime charged. I think the jury certainly should have been given that direction of law in this case. Third, although this might vary as a matter of personal approach between judges, I think it would have been helpful to the jury for the jury to have been informed that in this case the accused had had the benefit of knowledgeable counsel, that there was a ruling (as the jury would have anticipated from the afternoon before) which was a matter for the judge who determined the law, and that as a consequence the procedure now occurring had taken place. All of that would have had the benefit of including the jury in the process; because the jury, after all, was the judge of the facts. More fundamentally, it would have informed the jury as a matter of law so that the verdict was an informed verdict. The jury was in charge, as is evident, as his Honour appreciated: R. v Paprounas[29]. In my view the jury should have been given the directions I have stated.</p>\r\n<p>VINCENT JA: <br />31.&nbsp;The order of the Court is that this application for leave to appeal against conviction is dismissed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] Meaning by deferment of payment of the debt: Matthews v Fountain [1982] VR 1045 at 1049 cf.

The only access to L.''s property is via a strip of land on B P/L''s property. An easement in L.''s favour permits access to L.''s property. B P/L served a notice to fence on L. specifying the unfenced strip of land to be fenced and for provision of a double gate to allow access to L.''s property. Agreement was not reached and the matter referred to a magistrate. In dismissing the matter, the magistrate found that if the fence were constructed it would obstruct the view from L.''s property; that L. would lose the right to use any part of the strip of land for access; and that it would be an unreasonable impediment to L. and a diminution of L.''s rights to require the strip of land to be fenced. Upon appeal—</p>\r\n<p>HELD: Appeal allowed.</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;The policy behind the Fences Act (''Act'') is that it is appropriate that properties be fenced and that neighbours should share the cost of fencing equally. If B P/L''s land were not subject to the easement of carriageway, there is no question but that both parties would be rendered liable by s4 of the Act to construct or join in or contribute to the construction of a suffieient fence along the unfenced portion of the boundary. As the land is owned by B P/L, to make any order which denied them the right to fence their property could interfere significantly with their rights as to constitute an undue burden on servient tenement.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The erection of a fence along the boundary of the right of way in this case does not of itself constitute an unlawful interference with the right of way. Reasonable user of the right of way is achieved by gateways placed at appropriate places in the fence. Accordingly, the magistrate was in error in deciding that L. had a right to use for access to and from the servient tenement any part of the strip of land boundary which she chose to use. The magistrate was also in error in giving weight to the loss of amenity against the right of the owner of land to fence that land in a manner which was reasonable and which did not constitute a substantial interference with the rights of the owner of the dominant tenement, being the rights conferred by the grant of the easement.</p>\r\n<p>BALMFORD J:<br />1.&nbsp;This is an appeal under section 109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 against a final order made on 30 August 2004 by the Ringwood Magistrates’ Court, whereby it was ordered that a claim under the Fences Act 1968 (“the Act”) by the appellant (“Baypeak”) be dismissed and Baypeak pay to the defendant (“Mrs Lim”) the sum of $1613 costs. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;On 21 October 2004 Master Wheeler ordered that the questions of law shown by the appellant to be raised on the appeal were: </p>\r\n<p>(a) whether for the purposes of section 4 of the Fences Act 1958 the appellant and respondent being occupiers of adjoining lands are liable to construct, or join in or contribute to the construction of a dividing fence and/or a dividing fence and gate along an unfenced portion of boundary between their two properties which is subject to an easement of carriageway in favour of the respondent? <br />(b) whether the learned Magistrate in dismissing the appellant’s complaint took into account an irrelevant and extraneous consideration being the loss of amenity to the view available to the respondent? <br />(c) whether the learned Magistrate in dismissing the complaint erred at law in determining that it would be: <br />(i) an unreasonable impediment to the defendant to order the construction of a fence and gate; <br />(ii) a diminution of the defendant’s rights to require her to contribute to the fencing of the area in dispute; and <br />(iii) a substantial interference with the defendant’s rights to require her to contribute to the fencing of the area in dispute? <br />(d) whether as a natural and necessary incident to the use and enjoyment of that part of the appellant’s land which is subject to an easement of carriageway in favour of the respondent’s land: <br />(i) that the common boundary should be fenced in with an entrance gate erected to enable access to the respondent’s land; and <br />(ii) that it is not unreasonable that persons using the private road, (easement of carriage way), should open and close the gate, which is to be reasonably erected for that purpose, when they pass through the appellant’s property?</p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;Baypeak is, and has been for some two years the registered proprietor of a residential property known as 130-132 Central Road, Blackburn. Mrs Lim is, and has been for some sixteen years, the registered proprietor of an adjoining residential property, known as 134 Central Road, Blackburn. Baypeak’s property lies to the south of Mrs Lim’s property, save for a long strip of land, being part of Baypeak’s property, which abuts the western boundary of Mrs Lim’s property and runs north and south. The only access to Mrs Lim’s property is along a portion of that long strip of land which is subject to an easement of carriageway in her favour. The easement at its northern end connects with what is apparently a public road leading to Central Road. For 23 metres of its length the easement runs along the boundary between the two properties, (the eastern boundary of the long strip of Baypeak’s land and the western boundary of Mrs Lim’s land). That portion of the boundary (and that portion only) is unfenced, and is the only portion of the land subject to the easement which abuts Mrs Lim’s land, and thus the only means of access from Baypeak’s land to Mrs Lim’s land. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The easement was created by a transfer of land registered on 21 June 1979, using words which, by virtue of section 72(3) of the Transfer of Land Act 1958, in effect imported into the transfer the following words from the Twelfth Schedule to that Act (“the Twelfth Schedule”):<br />&nbsp;<br />Together with full and free right and liberty to and for the registered proprietor for the time being of [Mrs Lim’s property] or any part thereof and his tenants servants agents workmen and visitors to go pass and repass at all times hereafter and for all purposes and either with or without horses or other animals carts or other carriages into and out of and from the said land or any part thereof through over and along the [land subject to the easement]</p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;Baypeak served on Mrs Lim a Notice to Fence under section 6 of the Act specifying the unfenced 23 metres to be fenced (the fence to include a 3.5 metre double gate) and containing a proposal that by agreement a specified quotation be adopted and that the two parties contribute equally to the cost of fencing. Agreement was not reached, and Baypeak sought orders in the Magistrates’ Court that a fence (including double gates) be constructed in accordance with the town planning permit issued by the City of Whitehorse, that the costs be contributed equally, and that the gate remain closed save as required for reasonable access to Mrs Lim’s property. No issue arises as to the validity of the Notice to Fence. The town planning permit (which has now expired, but nothing turns on that) authorises a fence to match the existing timber paling fence, with a double gate 3.5 metres wide. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;Before the Magistrate, Mrs Lim opposed the construction of any fence, but her counsel indicated that if there were to be a fence she would prefer a ti-tree fence with no gate - that is, with an unfenced opening left to enable access to her property without the necessity to open and close gates. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;Sections 4 and 7 of the Act read so far as relevant: <br />4. Liability of occupiers of adjoining lands to fence despite agreements <br />(1) The occupiers of adjoining lands not divided by a fence sufficient for the purposes of both occupiers shall be liable to construct, or join in or contribute to the construction of, a dividing fence sufficient for the purposes of both occupiers between the adjoining lands in accordance with the following provisions— <br />. . . <br />(b) in other cases—the occupiers of the adjoining lands shall be liable to join in or contribute in such proportions as are agreed upon or, in the absence of agreement, are determined by the Magistrates’ Court under this Act. <br />. . . <br />7. In default of agreement, Court or arbitrator may decide <br />(1) If within one month after the service of a notice to fence the person serving and the person served with the notice do not agree upon the construction of a fence, the kind of fence to be constructed, or the proportions in which they are to join in or contribute to the construction of the fence, the Magistrates’ Court on the complaint of either of them may make an order prescribing-- <br />(a) the kind of fence to be constructed; <br />(b) the portion of the fence to be constructed by each person, or the proportion of the cost of constructing the fence to be contributed by each person; and <br />(c) where such further order is necessary, the position of the fence.</p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The issue before the Magistrate, as he stated, was whether or not he should declare that in all the circumstances Mrs Lim should contribute to the cost of the proposed fence and gate. He summarised his reasons for decision as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />So what would this fence and gate mean to the defendant? It would be loss of amenity and being able to look directly into the Blackburn Lake Sanctuary Reserve. It would be a loss of an entitlement to use any part of the 23 metres which she might choose from time to time to use as a right of way with vehicles leaving and parking off her property so that they are off the right of way and parked in the property. Or arguably you could fit vehicles along that length if you wanted to - no doubt there are trees and some shrubs in various places but she would have her rights to use that border to her property, she’d lose her rights to use it as she wishes. Why should she be confined to a gateway that is a standard gateway for a single vehicle? <br />I’ve mentioned the safety issue. I’ve mentioned the inconvenience of getting in and out of the vehicle in order to achieve this purpose [opening and shutting the gate] and there is also the added like inconvenience to guests and service personnel who might come to the property and necessarily park on this narrow right of way. <br />. . . <br />In my judgment, having heard all the evidence and looked at the exhibits and heard argument it would be an unreasonable impediment, in all the circumstances, upon her and a diminution in her rights, to require her to fence this area and there would be a substantial interference with her rights in my judgment. The case is dismissed.</p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The principles governing appeals against discretionary judgments were set out by Kitto J in Australian Coal and Shale Employees’ Federation v The Commonwealth [1] and have been frequently applied. His Honour said:<br />&nbsp;<br />I shall not repeat the references I made in Lovell v Lovell (1950) 81 CLR 513, at pp532-534 to cases of the highest authority which appear to me to establish that the true principle limiting the manner in which appellate jurisdiction is exercised in respect of decisions involving discretionary judgment is that there is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision appealed from, and that that decision should therefore be affirmed unless the court of appeal is satisfied that it is clearly wrong. A degree of satisfaction sufficient to overcome the strength of the presumption may exist where there has been an error which consists in acting upon a wrong principle, or giving weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or failing to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or making a mistake as to the facts. Again, the nature of the error may not be discoverable, but even so it is sufficient that the result is so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. </p>\r\n<p>The questions in the Master’s order must be considered in the light of those principles.</p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;As to question (a), it seems to me that the policy behind the Act is that it is appropriate that properties be fenced, that neighbours should share the cost of fences equally, but that a neighbour should be required to contribute only an appropriate share of the cost of a fence which is “sufficient for the purposes of both occupiers”. Thus if one party wishes to erect a fence which is more expensive than a sufficient fence would be, the Act does not (subject to such order as the Magistrates’ Court may make under section 7) inhibit that party from doing so; but it provides that that party must bear the additional cost occasioned by the more expensive fence. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;If Baypeak’s land were not subject to the easement of carriageway, there is no question but that both parties would be rendered liable by section 4 of the Act to construct or join in or contribute to the construction of a sufficient fence along the unfenced portion of the boundary. I note the passage from the judgment of Napier J of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Gohl v Hender, [2] cited with approval by Waddell J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Dunell v Phillips [3] that:<br />&nbsp;<br />It is a natural and necessary incident to the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff’s land that it should be fenced in. </p>\r\n<p>It is, of course, relevant that in that case the plaintiff was a dairy farmer and the land was used for stock. Nevertheless Southwell J in Wilson v Bahr, [4] dealing with residential property in Warrnambool, said, to similar effect:<br />&nbsp;<br />The disputed land is, after all, land owned by the defendants, and to make any order which denies them the right to fence their property is to interfere so significantly with their rights as to constitute an undue burden on the servient tenement. </p>\r\n<p>I would with respect adopt both of those passages as being of general application.</p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;The question is whether the existence of the easement affects the liability imposed on the parties by section 4. Clearly the erection along the 23 metres of a fence without a gate would be an impermissible interference with the right of the owner of Mrs Lim’s land, as the dominant tenement, to use the land subject to the easement, as the servient tenement, in order to pass and repass in and out of the dominant tenement. But what is proposed by the appellant is the erection of a fence containing a gate. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;The question thus is whether Mrs Lim has, as the Magistrate assumed, a right to pass and repass into her property at any point along the unfenced 23 metres of the boundary. He said:<br />&nbsp;<br />On the face of it, there is no reason why the defendant could not use the whole length of the 23 metres to drive vehicles through the right of way and park in her property. The fact that she chooses to go through a particular point is noted but that right of way gives her direct access on to her property. The plaintiff, in fact, is seeking orders that would restrict her from choosing what point along that length she should enter her property.</p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;The Magistrate made no reference to any authority in his reasons for decision. There are, however, a number of cases in point, some of which were cited before him. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Pettey v Parsons [5] was a decision of the English Court of Appeal (Cozens-Hardy MR, Swinfen Eady and Pickford LJJ). The terms of the grant of an easement of carriageway over what is referred to as “the blue land” were sufficiently similar to those in the Twelfth Schedule for the case to be of relevance in the present context. The Master of the Rolls said: [6]<br />&nbsp;<br />The defendant says, on the terms of the deed, which I have read, “I have not merely a right to pass in at one end of the blue road and out at the other, but I have a right to go to all or any part of my reserved land, and I have a right to go upon the blue land wherever I like and therefore I have a right to prevent the plaintiff from putting upon her own land any fence or division to rail it off.” Whether in the case of a private right of way like this there is or is not the right to enter upon the private road merely by defined gates or passages, or a right to enter at any other place where it is desired, seems to me to depend upon the construction of the deed itself. I will assume in favour of the defendant, without expressly deciding it, that before any building was erected on this property he might have made an access into the blue land where he liked; but to say that right entitled him as against the plaintiff to say, “The whole of this blue road which is next to me must be kept unfenced and open, so that at all times I may be at liberty from any point upon my land to get into this road,” seems to me to be a wholly untenable proposition. . . . Here in my view the contention of the defendant is wholly and absolutely unreasonable.</p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;Similarly, Swinfen Eady LJ said: [7]<br />&nbsp;<br />In each case it is a question of construction. Assuming in favour of the defendant that he is entitled to open new means of access to this roadway, he is not entitled to have it continuously unfenced along the whole of the line so that at every inch of the way he may pass on to it at any times he pleases.</p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;Pickford LJ said, after in effect agreeing with the Master of the Rolls and Swinfen Eady LJ: [8]<br />I think the obligation is that, assuming the right of access from each part of the land from which access is required to any part of the way, such access shall be given as will be reasonable. It is obviously difficult to explain, but it is an inevitable word, I think. It means such access as will give reasonable opportunity for the exercise of the right of way, or, to put it in another way, such access should be given as will not be a derogation from the grant of the right of way.</p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;In the Victorian case of Hose v Cobden [9] Mann J, dealing with a similar problem, found that on an undertaking being given by the complainant to allow any reasonable gateways in the fence, a fence between a lane on the complainant’s land over which the defendant had a right of way and the balance of the complainant’s land would not constitute a substantial interference with the defendant’s easement. He said: </p>\r\n<p>I may express a doubt as to whether a right of access “from the dominant tenement or any part thereof” necessarily involves a right of access from all parts thereof at all times. But whether that be so or not, the question of interference with the right of way must, I think, always be decided with reference to the conditions of user and occupation attaching to the lands in question by reason of their position and so on.</p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;Rath J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales followed both those decisions and others in a careful consideration of the position in Saggers v Brown. [10] His Honour said: [11] </p>\r\n<p>At the outset it is to be observed that there is a distinction between ownership of land giving rights to the soil and to every inch of the soil and the rights of enjoyment conferred by a grant of a right of way: Clifford v Hoare (1874) LR 9 CP 362 at 370-1 and Robertson v Abrahams [1930] WN (Eng) 79. The test to be applied in determining whether the right of way has been or is proposed to be unlawfully obstructed is whether what the defendants have done or propose to do is a substantial interference with the enjoyment of the right of way: Pettey v Parsons [1914] 2 Ch 653 at 662. . . .[Pettey v Parsons and Hose v Cobden [1921] VLR 617] show that the erection of a fence along the right of way is not necessarily an interference with the reasonable enjoyment of the way. Pettey v Parsons lays down, as a matter of general principle, that the grant of a right of way does not confer a right to go upon the right of way from any part of the dominant tenement adjoining the right of way. What the grant of the right of way involves is such access as shall be reasonable: see Lewis v Wakeling (1923) 54 OLR 647. The grant of the right of way is to be construed according to its language having regard to the surrounding circumstances at the time of the grant. It is necessary to determine whether the use claimed was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time when the grant was made and all relevant circumstances are to be considered: Todrick v Western National Omnibus Company Ltd [1934] 1 Ch 190 at 206-7; on appeal [1934] 1 Ch 561 at 576, 577, 592. The question of unlawful interference with the right of way is to be determined having regard to the reasonable requirements of the dominant tenement from time to time: Keefe v Anor [1965] 1 QB 334 at 346-7; McKellar v Guthrie [1920] NZLR 729-31. The grant in this case is a general right of way, that is to say there is no terminus a quo or terminus ad quem but neither this circumstance nor the wording of the grant, permitting, as it does, passage from any part of the dominant tenement with which the right is capable of enjoyment, precludes reasonable user of the servient tenement and, in particular, fencing of the servient tenement. . . . </p>\r\n<p>Applying these principles I am of the opinion that the erection of a fence along the boundary of the right of way in this case does not of itself necessarily constitute an unlawful interference with the right of way. Reasonable user of the right of way is achieved by gateways placed at appropriate places in the fence.</p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;Waddell J in Dunell v Phillips referred to “the natural presumption that a servient owner should be entitled to fence his land” as being “a matter of considerable importance to be taken into account in deciding what inference is to be drawn from the circumstances existing at the time of the grant of the right of way.” [12] In that case he found that consideration to be outweighed by other circumstances in the particular case before him. He relied on Pettey v Parsons, Hose v Cobden, Saggers v Brown and other cases as authority for the proposition that “in cases where a right of way is wide enough to permit the purpose for which it was granted and in the absence of any provision in the grant to the contrary and in the absence of the purpose for which the right of way was granted requiring otherwise, the servient owner is entitled to fence the common boundary and the dominant owner is entitled to access to the right of way by means of gates at such points as reasonably meet his requirements”. [13] </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;In Butler v Muddle [14] Young J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales was concerned with this question. He said: [15]<br />&nbsp;. . . prima facie the servient owner is entitled to fence a right of way and gain security for his land along the whole of the boundary unless he interferes with what the parties intended to be the spots from which the holder of the dominant tenement was to have access. (Dunnell v Phillips (1982) 2 BPR 9517, 9522). </p>\r\n<p>And, after considering the submissions of both parties before him<br />&nbsp;<br />One must look at the reasonableness of it all when construing the grant and, in my view, the defendants are entitled to access from more than one point, but only such access as is reasonable; see Pettey v Parsons [1914] 2 Ch 653 and Hose v Cobden [1921] VLR 617. </p>\r\n<p>In that case, the defendants, the owners of the dominant tenement, proposed to construct a building according to plans providing for three access points from the easement, totalling 13 metres out of a length 23 metres. His Honour found, in all the circumstances of that case, that a total of nine metres for access points was reasonable. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;There is no evidence before the Court as to the intention of the parties at the time of the creation of the easement in 1979, and I do not consider that any reliable inference can be drawn from the fact that the 23 metre strip along the boundary has remained unfenced. I should also note that it was not suggested that Mrs Lim or her predecessors as owners of the dominant tenement had acquired any prescriptive right to cross the boundary at any point in the 23 metre strip. It is necessary to look to the present circumstances in order to determine whether the proposal of the appellant is reasonable, or whether it would constitute a substantial interference with the enjoyment of the easement by Mrs Lim, as the owner of the dominant tenement. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;It is necessary, as I have said, to look at the matter in the light of the passage from the judgment of Kitto J cited in [9] above. I find, on the basis of the authorities to which I have referred, that the Magistrate acted upon two wrong principles of law, namely: that Mrs Lim, as the owner of the dominant tenement, had a right to use, for access to and from the servient tenement, any part of the 23 metres boundary which she chose to use; and that Baypeak, as the owner of the servient tenement, was not entitled to erect a fence and gate on that boundary. The effect of those findings is that I find the answer to question (a) to be Yes. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;As to question (b), noting the passages from Gohl v Hender and Wilson v Bahr which are cited in [11] above, I find that, in taking into account the loss of amenity caused by the inability of Mrs Lim to look into the Blackburn Lake Reserve, the Magistrate gave weight to an irrelevant matter. That loss of amenity is not, in my view, a matter to be given weight against the right of the owner of land to fence that land in a manner which is reasonable and which does not constitute a substantial interference with the rights of the owner of the dominant tenement, being the rights conferred by the grant of the easement. Accordingly, I find the answer to question (b) to be Yes. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;As to question (c), it is apparent from the authorities that the construction of a fence and gate across an easement of carriage way is not, in itself, an unreasonable or substantial interference with the rights of the adjoining owner as owner of the dominant tenement. There may be circumstances in a particular case, where a particular proposed fence and gate may constitute such an interference; see for example Powell v Langdon [16] where the proposed fence and gate were such as to cause an obstruction to the right of way, rendering it, as the court found “too narrow for ordinary convenience”. It is not suggested that that will be the case here. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;It was put for Mrs Lim that the construction of the proposed fence and gate would, in a manner which I did not understand, affect her ability to use her car port, and would limit the area in which visitors to her property could park, particularly on the one day of the year when the property is open to the public. Further, access to the wheelchair ramp outside the house (which is only used on that one day) would be less convenient. However, while she may have found, as a result of the absence of a fence, that in those respects there was greater flexibility in the use of her land than there would be if there were a fence, that flexibility does not derive from the easement of carriage way, but from the absence of a fence. None of these matters is an incident of her rights as owner of the dominant tenement; and the loss of that flexibility cannot be regarded as an interference with her rights in that capacity. The answer to question (c)(i) is accordingly Yes. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;The requirement that Mrs Lim contribute to the fencing of the 23 metre strip is imposed by the Act and for that reason cannot be regarded a diminution of, or a substantial interference with, any right of hers as owner of the dominant tenement or otherwise. The answer to questions (c)(ii) and (c)(iii) is accordingly Yes. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;As to question (d), it follows from the authorities cited in [11] above that the answer to question (d)(i) must be Yes. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;As to question (d)(ii), it was put that Mrs Lim’s main concern was what she considered to be the legal burden of closing the gate which would be imposed on her if the proposed fence and gate were constructed. She was concerned that she would be responsible if the gate were left open and a child were to get through from Baypeak’s property and drown in the lake which is partly on her land. Given that she prefers to have no fence and no gate I do not understand the force of this concern. At present, given that the boundary is unfenced because of the decision of the Magistrate occasioned by her opposition to the fence, she might well feel a similar responsibility in such circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;Question (d)(ii), in the circumstances of the present case, seems to me to be a question of fact rather than of law, and accordingly it is not necessary to answer it. However, some guidance may be obtained from the judgment of Napier J in Gohl v Hender in which case, it is to be remembered, the land in question was used for stock. His Honour said [17] of a proposal to put a gate across land, referred to as “the private road”, which was subject to a carriageway easement:<br />&nbsp;<br />In my view of the case, it is a natural and necessary incident to the use and enjoyment of the plaintiffs’ land that it should be fenced in and in the circumstances of the case it is not unreasonable that persons using the private road should open and close the gate - which is reasonably erected for that purpose - when they pass through the plaintiffs’ property. <br />. . . </p>\r\n<p>The Full Court has held that an action would not lie for merely leaving the gate open, and it is implied in the reasons for judgment that there may be times when it is so inconvenient to close it that it would not be unreasonable to leave it open. But in the ordinary course of things I think that any person who is entitled to open the gate in the exercise of the right, and thereby to interfere with the plaintiffs’ property for the purpose of passing through it, acts unreasonably if, having opened the gate, he leaves it open when he knows, or ought to know, that it is, or may be, necessary to keep in the stock depastured on the land. I think this is implied in the summing-up of Scrutton J in Attorney-General v Meyrick [[1915] 79 JP 515] where he speaks of the public “having to open and close the gates when they want to pass,” and, in my view of the facts, it is a fair and reasonable basis for the adjustment of the rights and obligations of the parties. </p>\r\n<p>His Honour went on to order inter alia that the defendants were “under a duty or obligation to close [the gate] when they . . . have opened it in the exercise of the rights conferred by the easement, unless the circumstances of the particular occasion afford some sufficient reason or excuse for leaving it open”. He granted an injunction to restrain the defendants from any unreasonable use of the private road by leaving the gate open in breach of that duty or obligation. He recommended that the parties “as reasonable people . . . endeavour to adjust their differences upon the basis of live and let live” and referred to “a simple application of the principles of good sense and forbearance.”</p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;For the reasons given, the appeal will be allowed. Counsel may wish to make submissions as to the form of the orders and as to costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] (1953) 94 CLR 621 at 627 <br />[2] [1930] SASR 158 at 163 <br />[3] (1982) 2 BPR 9517 at 9522 <br />[4] (1991) V Conv R 54-392 at 22 <br />[5] [1914] 2 Ch 653 <br />[6] at 662-3 <br />[7] at 667 <br />[8] at 669 <br />[9] [1921] VLR 617 at 620 <br />[10] (1981) 2 BPR 9329 <br />[11] at 9331-2 <br />[12] at 9522 <br />[13] at 9522 <br />[14] (1995) 6 BPR 13,984 <br />[15] at 4 <br />[16] (1944) 61 WN (NSW) 238 at 240 <br />[17] at 163-5.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the appellant Baypeak Pty Ltd: Mr RA Edmunds, counsel.

Later, DeJ. sought leave to file an amended statement of claim which altered a number of allegations concerning what actually occurred at the site. The defendant filed a summons to have the proceeding dismissed.<br /><br /><strong>HELD: Leave granted to DeJ. to file and serve an amended statement of claim. Defendants summons dismissed.<br />DeJ.s cause of action is libel in that he had driven a motor vehicle whilst affected by illegal drugs and it was published, in various forms, by four Melbourne television stations on the evening of the day upon which he was tested at the roadside testing station. There may be cases where the words spoken by an alleged accessory to a libel are important, even vital, to the maintenance of a cause of action against that accessory where direct publication of the libel is by another. But that is not this case. The actual words used to convey information to the ultimate publisher of a libel are not a necessary part of the cause of action; the information conveyed by the words is. The libels for which the defendant is sought to be made ultimately liable here are those which were broadcast by the television stations in their evening news programmes. The accessorial liability of the Victoria Police and hence the defendant will depend upon DeJ. proving the police invitation to the media, specifically the four television stations, its conveying to them the information that the plaintiff whom they identified had tested positive on two separate occasions for illegal drugs and the inferences available from such facts.<br />BONGIORNO J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;On 13 December 2004, for the first time, the Victoria Police set up a roadside testing station for the purpose of testing drivers for the presence of illicit drugs in their bodies. The location chosen was Whitehall Street, Yarraville. John De Jong was one of the first drivers tested. He was, by occupation, a courier/driver. Although Mr De Jong apparently tested positive for drugs, both on a kerbside test and then on a more sophisticated test administered in the police van, a third test conducted in a laboratory cleared him of drug ingestion. He was never charged with any offence. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;On 16 May 2005 Mr De Jong sued the State of Victoria for damages, including aggravated and/or exemplary damages for injury to his reputation which he claims was caused by the broadcast of television news programmes on four of the Melbourne metropolitan television stations on the evening of the day of his drug test. Each of those news broadcasts showed pictures of Mr De Jong in various positions at the roadside testing station and reported that he had tested positive for drugs in his system. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;His claim against the State of Victoria is based upon its responsibility for members of the Victoria Police in the execution of their functions as police officers and State employees. He purports to make his case by pleading that the police invited the media to attend the roadside testing station in Whitehall Street and that after he had been tested a police officer or other employee of the Victoria Police had informed the members of the press who attended that Mr De Jong had tested positive on the two occasions referred to. He pleads various imputations arising from the television broadcasts which, he says, were either intended by the Victoria Police or were a natural and probable consequence of inviting members of the press to Whitehall Street at the relevant time, identifying him and telling them he had tested positive. In effect the plaintiff’s claim is that members of the Victoria Police or its employees were complicit in the television stations’ defamation of him in their news broadcasts. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;By its defence to the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the State of Victoria has joined issue with various of his allegations and made a number of positive allegations of its own. It denies that any member of the Victoria Police intended any of the impugned broadcasts or that they were the natural and probable consequence of the actions of the Victoria Police or its employees. It alleges that each of the broadcasts was made in contravention of express directions and requests made by members of the Victoria Police to the media representatives who were present at the relevant time.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;By a summons filed 2 February 2006 the plaintiff has sought leave to file an amended statement of claim which, as well as making a formal alteration to the basis of his claim against the State of Victoria, would alter a number of allegations concerning what actually occurred at the testing site. On 13 February the defendant filed a summons seeking to have this proceeding dismissed, pursuant to RSC r 23.01 or the plaintiff’s statement of claim struck out as not disclosing a cause of action, pursuant to RSC r 23.02. It is these two summonses which are the subject of this judgment. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;As the plaintiff’s proposed amendments should be allowed provided they are not inutile because the proceeding itself should be terminated, it is appropriate to consider the defendant’s application in light of the plaintiff’s proposed amended statement of claim. This course was acceded to by Mr Dreyfus QC for the defendant.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The central facts relevant to this proceeding which will be pleaded by the plaintiff in his amended statement of claim if leave is granted to file it, may be summarised as follows:-<br />&#9679; The Victoria Police invited representatives of the media, including television stations, to attend at a site at Whitehall Street, Yarraville on 13 December 2004 to observe the operation of the first random roadside drug testing station. <br />&#9679; A representative of the Victoria Police, Sean Cadd, told media representatives that a driver had tested positive to methylamphetamine in a road side test. <br />&#9679; Sean Cadd or an unidentified police officer or officers subsequently told media representatives that the same driver had again tested positive on a more sophisticated test in the police testing van. <br />&#9679; The plaintiff was identified by Victoria Police officers as that driver. <br />&#9679; A number of television stations, in various forms, reported the above facts with pictures including pictures of the plaintiff in their evening news broadcasts.<br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff’s cause of action is libel. The libel was that the plaintiff had driven a motor vehicle whilst affected by illegal drugs. It was published, in various forms, by four Melbourne television stations on the evening of the day upon which he was tested in Whitehall Street. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The defendant, which is alleged to be vicariously liable for the acts of the Victoria Police and its employees, submitted that the plaintiff’s proposed amended statement of claim does not disclose a cause of action and should be struck out or disallowed. Alternatively, it argues that the plaintiff’s claim is deficient in that the words spoken by Cadd are not set out as they ought to be in a claim of libel; the media representatives to whom Cadd spoke are not identified and nor are members of the Victoria Police who are alleged (alternatively to Cadd) to have told the assembled media representatives that the plaintiff had tested positive on the test taken in the police van. It also criticised the pleading by the plaintiff of the alleged intent of the Victoria Police in inviting media representatives to the launch of the random drug testing system. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>Webb v Bloch</em>[1] Isaacs J dealt with the meaning of "publication" in the context of defamation. He included what might now be termed accessorial liability for publication as attaching to anyone who intentionally lent his assistance to the existence of the publication. His Honour spoke in terms of principal and agent and quoted statements of Lord Loreburn LC and Lord Hailsham in <em>S Pearson &amp; Son Limited v Dublin Corporation</em>[2] as authority for the proposition that principal and agent inter se are each principals in relation to the person defamed. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;In this case the plaintiff has pleaded facts which, if proved, would justify a finding that the members of Victoria Police engaged the media representatives who attended at Whitehall Street as their agents for purposes connected with the dissemination of information concerning random drug testing of drivers. The proposed amended statement of claim then pleads facts which, if proved, would establish that the plaintiff was identified to the press representatives present, by the actions of members of the Victoria Police in escorting him to the roadside testing van, as being the person a police media spokesman said had twice tested positive for illegal drugs. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;The defendant complains that the plaintiff has not pleaded the words spoken by the police media spokesman, Cadd, which are alleged to be defamatory. But the plaintiff’s case here is not based on what Cadd said but rather upon the whole of the circumstances in which Cadd informed the press of the plaintiff’s positive drug tests. The words used are not important. It is the information which was conveyed by what he said together with the actions performed by one or more police officers which, the plaintiff says, lead to his being libelled in the television news broadcasts. The pleading identifies precisely the information allegedly conveyed by Cadd. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The defendant relied upon the judgment of Nicholas J in <em>Zunter v John Fairfax Publications</em>[3] in which his Honour criticised a pleading which was deficient in particulars. But, unlike here, that case was concerned only with words spoken, not with the circumstance in which information was conveyed to the media and the actions of those who conveyed it. His Honour referred to <em>Sim v Wran</em>, another case concerning, inter alia, a deficiency in particulars. Zunter is of little assistance in this case. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The defendant also referred to <em>Gunns Limited v Marr &amp; Others</em>[4]. Again, this case is concerned with the adequacy of a statement of claim to convey the plaintiff’s case. It has no relevance here. There is nothing in this aspect of the defendant’s complaint. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Just as the solicitor in <em>Webb v Bloch</em>[5] was employed to compose "a form of circular he would advise being sent to each grower and contributor" so, here the plaintiff’s case is that the press, including the television stations, were either enlisted by the Victoria Police to publish an alleged libel about the plaintiff or that was the natural and probable consequence of the actions they performed and the information disseminated by Cadd (or a police officer) as spokesman for the Victoria Police. There is no requirement that the plaintiff plead the actual words spoken by Cadd, as, if the Victoria Police and hence the State of Victoria is liable, that liability is for the libels published by the television stations which are, of course, pleaded in the ordinary way. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;There may be cases where the words spoken by an alleged accessory to a libel are important, even vital, to the maintenance of a cause of action against that accessory where direct publication of the libel is by another. But that is not this case. The actual words used to convey information to the ultimate publisher of a libel are not a necessary part of the cause of action; the information conveyed by the words is. The libels for which the defendant is sought to be made ultimately liable here are those which were broadcast by the television stations in their evening news programmes. The accessorial liability of the Victoria Police and hence the defendant will depend upon the plaintiff proving the police invitation to the media, specifically the four television stations, its conveying to them the information that the plaintiff whom they identified had tested positive on two separate occasions for illegal drugs and the inferences available from such facts. The facts will need to establish one or more of the situations contemplated by Lopes J in <em>Speight v Gosney</em>[6] as giving rise to liability for a libel published by another. See also <em>Cook v SA Trotting Association</em>.[7] <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;The plaintiff’s proposed pleading with respect to the person or persons who spoke to media representatives at Whitehall Street is adequate. It names Sean Cadd and/or a member or members of the Victoria Police. Their specific identities are not essential ingredients of the plaintiff’s cause of action. Proof of the pleaded facts would be sufficient to establish the chain of liability back to the defendant. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;Similarly, it is not necessary for the plaintiff in his pleading or particulars to identify, by name, the media representatives to whom Cadd (or the police officer) spoke. Should the plaintiff prove only that unidentified representatives of the media were present at Whitehall Street when Cadd or the police officer spoke he may have to rely upon the tribunal of fact drawing inferences in his favour as to the connection between those journalists, what they were told and the publications upon which he sues. The strength of those inferences, and whether they can legitimately be drawn in the circumstances at all, will depend upon the evidence tendered to support them. However the pleading is adequate. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;In order to succeed on an application for summary dismissal of this proceeding pursuant to RSC r 23.01 the defendant would have had to demonstrate the plaintiff’s case was frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process and/or that it was, in practical terms, hopeless: <em>Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners</em>.[8] To succeed on an application to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim pursuant to RSC r 23.02 the defendant would have had to have demonstrated that the statement of claim did not disclose a cause of action, was scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, would prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the proceeding or was otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. It has not succeeded on either limb of its application.<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;In the circumstances the plaintiff should have leave to file and serve an amended statement of claim in the form which he proposed. The defendant’s summons of 13 February 2006 should be dismissed. I will hear the parties on the form of appropriate orders, further directions and costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 364. <br />[2] (1907) AC 351. <br />[3] [2004] NSW SC 696. <br />[4] [2005] VSC 251. <br />[5] (1928) 41 CLR 331 at 363. <br />[6] (1891) 60 LJQB 231. <br />[7] [1930] SASR 166. <br />[8] (1949) 78 CLR 62 particularly per Dixon J at 91.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the plaintiff DeJong: Mr SK Wilson QC and Mr DP Gilbertson, counsel.

P. was charged with an offence under s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 (Act) in that P. was in possession of money which may be reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime. The magistrate held that there was no case to answer on the basis that there was no evidence of the subjective suspicion of the police informant that the money found on P. was the proceeds of crime. The magistrate dismissed the charge. Upon appeal—<br /><br />HELD: Appeal upheld. <br />1.&nbsp;Whilst the magistrate followed a decision by Warren CJ in <em>DPP v Bodouloh</em>, there were other decisions of appellate courts in South Australia and New South Wales which dealt with a provision in a Federal Act virtually identical in effect to s123 of the Act. In those circumstances, the magistrate should have construed the provisions of s123 as that section was construed in the interstate cases.<br />2.&nbsp;It is for the tribunal of fact trying the charge under s123 of the Act to consider whether the property in question may be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. The police informants suspicion is irrelevant. <br />&nbsp;<em>DPP v Bodouloh </em>MC40/03, not followed.<br />3.&nbsp;What the magistrate was required to do in considering the no case submission was to ask the question whether on the evidence as it stood at the end of the prosecution case there was evidence upon which P. could lawfully be convicted of being in possession of a sum of money which may be suspected of being proceeds of crime. This is a question of law. In the circumstances P. had a case to answer and it was not open to the magistrate to have found otherwise.&nbsp;<br />BONGIORNO J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;Section 123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997[1] made it an offence for a person to receive, possess, conceal, dispose of or bring into Victoria any money or other property that may reasonably be suspected of being proceeds of crime. The same section provided for a penalty of 2 years’ imprisonment or a level 7 fine or both. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Savas Pastras was charged with an offence under s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 in respect of some $44,000 in cash found on his person when searched by police at the home of one Lewis Moran on 25 October 2002. The circumstances in which Pastras was apprehended may be summarised from the evidence eventually led before the Broadmeadows Magistrates’ Court as follows. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;On the day in question the appellant, Senior Detective Victor Anastasiadis, with other police, attended Moran’s premises at 1/7 Washington Street, Essendon to execute a search warrant issued pursuant to the <em>Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act </em>1981. When they arrived there Moran and one Virginia Strazdas were present. As the appellant was speaking to Strazdas he saw, through a window, the respondent Pastras walking towards the front door. He asked Strazdas who the person he saw was and she told him that it was a friend and that she would tell him to go away. She stood up and went straight to the door, ignoring an order from one of the other police officers not to do so. The appellant saw Strazdas open the door, put her head out and, whilst drawing the door back behind her so as to obscure the police view of Pastras, he heard Strazdas say in a hissed and loud tone “Go away”. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Immediately after this event the appellant went to the door, opened it and recognised the person there as Pastras who was already known to him. He described the respondent’s face as having a “shocked expression” and said that he started to shake. He directed Pastras to come into the house where he was searched. A package containing bundles of $100 and $50 notes to a total value of $44,000 were found on him. In the course of being searched the appellant described Pastras as being in a state of shock. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;In due course Pastras was charged with the offence under s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 and appeared before the Broadmeadows Court on 22 April 2004. He pleaded not guilty to the charge, which was dismissed by the Magistrate who found that he had no case to answer. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;This appeal concerns the Magistrate’s finding that Pastras had no case to answer in respect of the charge of being in possession of money which may be reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime; it being alleged on the appellant’s behalf that there was evidence which ought to have required the respondent to make his defence to the charge.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;A perusal of the transcript before the Magistrate reveals that the case was conducted before her on the basis that one of the elements of the offence was that one or other (or perhaps all) of the police officers involved had to be proven to have had a reasonable suspicion that the money found on Pastras when he was searched at Moran’s premises were the proceeds of crime. The prosecution led no evidence going to the issue of suspicion other than that of the police officers concerned. This course is consistent with what I perceive to have been the view of the law held not only by the Magistrate but also by the prosecutor. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;In his evidence-in-chief the appellant said that:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;“The money that was located on Mr&nbsp;Pastras I suspected as being the proceeds of crime and the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceeds of drug sales.”<br />In cross-examination he conceded that his suspicion was that the money was to be used to pay Lewis Moran for drugs obtained on credit. He acceded to a proposition put to him by counsel for Pastras that for all that he knew the funds might be legitimate funds borrowed from a legitimate source and that his suspicion was that those funds were to be used for a drug transaction.<br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;None of the other four police officers called gave any evidence in chief as to their suspicions with respect to this money but each of them, in cross-examination, conceded that they suspected that it was to be used for the purpose of paying for a drug transaction. With the exception of the evidence of the appellant to which I have referred none of them gave evidence as to any suspicion that the money was, itself, the proceeds of crime within the definition contained in the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;In her decision the Magistrate reviewed this evidence and concluded that each of the police officers had the reasonable suspicion that the money was to be used in connection with a drug deal between Pastras and Moran. She said that it was not reasonable to conclude that because the money was for the purpose of consummating a drug deal that it was itself derived or realised either directly or indirectly from the commission of a criminal offence as it had to be to fit the definition of the proceeds of crime as set out in the Act. She ruled that the respondent had no case to answer and dismissed the charge.<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;In dismissing the charge against the respondent the Magistrate applied a decision of this Court, <em>DPP v Bodouloh</em>[2] in which Warren&nbsp;CJ had considered the operation of s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 and concluded that the test by which the question of reasonable suspicion for the purposes of the section had to be determined was a subjective test, in the sense that “... it must appear to the informant that reasonable grounds exist to support the suspicion and the belief”. Her Honour went on to hold that, as in that case the Magistrate had excluded the evidence of the informant and other police as to their belief, he had rendered it impossible for him to make the necessary findings of fact as to suspicion. She thus upheld the prosecution appeal. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate in this case considered herself bound by the decision in Bodouloh. It would appear that she reached this conclusion even though she was referred to decisions of intermediate appellate courts of other States dealing with s82 of the <em>Proceeds of Crime Act </em>1987 (Cth), a provision which is virtually identical in effect to s123 of the Victorian Act. In particular, she was referred to <em>R v Zotti</em>[3], a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia and <em>R v Buckett</em>[4], a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales. Each of those cases concerning s82 of the federal Act would have required the application of a different test to determine the adequacy of the prosecution case. That they are relevant to the interpretation of s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 follows as a logical corollary of the principle referred to by Young&nbsp;CJ in <em>R v Parsons</em>[5], to the effect that where any State court is concerned to construe a provision of a federal Act, that State court should defer to appellate courts of other States which have considered the federal statute where there is no binding authority of the local appellate court. The principle has been accepted by the High Court: <em>Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd</em>[6]. Accordingly, s123 of the State Act should be construed as being to the same effect as s82 of the federal Act; that is to say it should be construed as that section was construed in cases such as <em>Zotti </em>and <em>Buckett</em>. See also <em>McGee; ex parte McGee v McKeever</em>[7]. The Magistrate was not referred to Parsons or Marlborough Gold and, not surprisingly, took the course of holding herself bound by the decision of this Court to which I have referred. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;In reaching the conclusion which she did in <em>Bodouloh</em>, Warren&nbsp;CJ considered the decision of Kellam J in <em>Rinaldi v Watts</em>[8] and decisions on s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act </em>1966 and its predecessors as being a source of jurisprudence applicable to the construction of s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act</em> 1997. Her Honour analysed a number of such authorities and concluded that they compelled the construction of s123 which she adopted. Neither she nor Kellam J were, unfortunately, referred to the New South Wales cases discussed hereunder or to <em>R v Zotti</em>[9], <em>R v Buckett</em>[10] or to the federal statute. The argument in both cases seems to have concentrated on s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act </em>1966 and its similarity to s123. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The offence commonly referred to in Victoria as “unlawful possession”, now found in s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act</em>, had its origin in a differently worded provision of an enactment passed in England in the second year of the reign of Queen Victoria. That statute was adopted in New South Wales in 1855 and became s1 of Act 19 Vict. No. 24. It appeared in this form:<br />“Every person who shall be brought before any Justice of the Peace charged with having in his possession or conveying in any manner anything which may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained and who shall not give an account to the satisfaction of such Justice how he came by the same shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour.”<br />That section was re-enacted in substantially the same form as s27 of the <em>Police Offences Act </em>1901 (NSW), whence it came to Victoria in 1907 as s10 of the <em>Police Offences Act </em>1907 in the following form:<br />“10 (1) Any person having in his possession or conveying in any manner any personal property whatsoever suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained may be apprehended either with or without warrant and brought before a Court of Petty Sessions. <br />(2) If such person does not in the opinion of the Court give a satisfactory account as to how he came by the same he shall on conviction be liable to be imprisoned either with or without hard labour for any time not exceeding 12 months(3) The said property if proved to be or to have been in the possession of the accused whether in a building or otherwise and whether the possession thereof had been parted with by the accused before being brought before the said Court or not shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be in the possession of the said accused.”<br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;By the <em>Police Offences Act </em>1912, s10 was amended by inserting the word “actual” before the word “possession” and by inserting a provision as to summoning the accused as an alternative to arresting him. See generally <em>Moors v Burke</em>[11]. <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The provision remained in the same form through subsequent consolidations of the Victorian Statutes but when it was re-enacted as s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act </em>1966 the word “reasonably” was inserted before the word “suspected” in subs.(1). It has remained in that form since except for the addition of a further subsection which is of no interest for present purposes. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;In New South Wales, s27 of the <em>Police Offences Act </em>1901, which was the progenitor of s26 of our Summary Offences Act, was amended in 1908 to read as follows: <br />“27. Whosoever being charged before a Justice with:- <br />(a) having anything in his custody; or <br />(b) knowingly having anything in the custody of another person; or <br />(c) knowingly having anything in a house, building, lodging, apartment, field, or other place, whether belonging to or occupied by himself or not, or whether such thing is there had, or placed for his own use or the use of another, which thing may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, does not give an account to the satisfaction of such Justice how he came by the same, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.”<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;Section 27 was replaced in 1970 by s40 of the <em>Summary Offences Act </em>and was eventually subsumed into the <em>Crimes Act </em>1900 (NSW) as s527C which is in the following terms: <br />“527C (1) Any person who: <br />(a) has any thing in his custody; <br />(b) has any thing in the custody of another person;<br />(c) has any thing in or on premises, whether belonging to or occupied by himself or not, or whether that thing is there for his own use or the use of another; or<br />(d) gives custody or any thing to a person who is not lawfully entitled to possession of the thing, which thing may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained, shall be liable on conviction before a stipendiary magistrate to imprisonment for six months, or to a fine of $500. <br />(2) It is a sufficient defence to a prosecution for an offence under subs (1) if the defendant satisfies the court that he had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the thing referred to in the charge was stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. <br />(3) In this section ‘premises’ includes any structure, building, vehicle, vessel, whether decked or undecked, or place, whether built upon or not, and any part thereof.”<br />The offence created by these enactments is commonly referred to in New South Wales as “goods in custody” or latterly “things in custody”.<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;Since its enactment in Victoria, the provision which is now s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act </em>has been construed as requiring the arresting officer to have the necessary suspicion (since 1966 the necessary reasonable suspicion) concerning the goods found in the accused’s possession contemporaneously with their being in that possession. Thus Hodges&nbsp;J in <em>Brown v Schiffman</em>[12] expressed the situation thus: <br />“In my opinion, to bring a person within this section the possession and suspicion must exist at the same point of time, and unless there is possession and suspicion at the same point of time (the arresting officer) would have no authority to bring (the accused) up before the Court under this section. I think that is manifestly the intention of the Legislature. It is a summary procedure dealing with persons who, so to speak, are caught red handed, caught, in the ordinary technical expression, <em>flagrante delicto</em>. Proceedings are thereupon taken with warrant or without warrant, not because (the accused) is in possession of property or because it is suspected that she was at some time or other in possession of stolen property, but because she is in possession of property suspected of being stolen.”<br />As Hodges J points out, contemporaneity of suspicion and possession is required to justify the arrest by the arresting officer. Thus, it is an implied requirement of the section that it is the arresting officer who must have the necessary (reasonable) suspicion. If he did not, then his arrest would be unjustified and hence unlawful. See also <em>Tatchell v Lovett</em>[13], <em>McPherson v Goldstone</em>[14], <em>Olholm v Clink</em>[15] and <em>Moors v Burke</em>[16].<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;The situation described by Hodges&nbsp;J in <em>Brown v Schiffman </em>is still the case in Victoria when a charge of unlawful possession is before a Court. The notion of arrest (although now accompanied by the possibility of a summons) is still an inherent part of the procedure prescribed by s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act</em>. Contemporaneity of actual possession and reasonable suspicion by the investigating police officer is still required to sustain a conviction. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;It is otherwise in New South Wales. Although the original 1855 New South Wales Statute incorporated the concept of arrest in the section dealing with the possession of suspected goods, from 1908 onwards s27 of the <em>Police Offences Act</em>, which then incorporated the “goods in custody” offence has been divorced completely from a different provision (s36) which authorised police constables to stop, search and detain persons who might be reasonably suspected of having or conveying anything stolen or unlawfully obtained. Section 27 has been, since 1908, an independent, offence creating section: <em>Ex parte Patmoy; Re Jack</em>[17]. In that case Jordan&nbsp;CJ traced the origins of the offence and reached the conclusion that by 1908 the offence created by s27 of the <em>Police Offences Act </em>1901 had to be viewed according to its natural meaning, unencumbered by any concept of the necessity for the justification of an arrest. His Honour construed s27 as follows: <br />“According to its natural meaning, read as a piece of English, it now deals with persons having in their custody, or knowingly having in the custody of another person, or in a house or other place, anything which may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained. It takes its stand at the point when such a person is charged before a magistrate with so having a thing with respect to which such suspicion may be reasonably entertained, and it provides that if he does not give an account, to the magistrate’s satisfaction, of how he came by it, he shall be liable to a penalty. It follows, in my opinion, that what the section now requires is that, at the time when the charge is being heard for the purpose of being disposed of, it is for the magistrate to decide, in the first instance, on the evidence then placed before him, whether he is satisfied (beyond reasonable doubt, since it is a criminal charge) that it is then proper to entertain a reasonable suspicion that the thing was stolen or unlawfully obtained.”<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;<em>Ex parte Patmoy; Re Jack </em>has been followed in many cases in New South Wales. In one such case, <em>R v English</em>[18] Gleeson&nbsp;CJ said:<br />“It is now settled law in this State that when a Magistrate deals with a charge of goods in custody it is the duty of the Magistrate to decide whether he is satisfied, at the time of his decision, that it is then proper to entertain a reasonable suspicion that the goods were stolen or unlawfully obtained: <em>Ex parte Patmoy; Re Jack</em>; <em>Cleary v Hammond</em>[19] and <em>Abbrederis</em>[20]. The existence of such a suspicion is related in time to the proceedings before the Magistrate rather than the arrest or charging of the accused.”<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Section 123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 says nothing about the arrest or charging of a person accused of a breach of it. It leaves the procedure for bringing such person before a court to the provisions of the general law. Nor is it concerned solely with the question of possession, actual or otherwise. It prohibits the performance of a number of different acts in relation to the suggested proceeds of crime. There is nothing in the section which implies the necessity for any contemporaneity between the required suspicion and any of those acts. Indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to apply a notion of contemporaneity between the required suspicion and some, at least, of the actions prohibited by the section. Finally, there would appear to be no warrant for incorporating into the section a requirement that the police informant (or any other investigating police officer) have the necessary reasonable suspicion. The police officer’s suspicion is irrelevant. It is not an element of the offence. So much appears clear from the use of the modal verb “may” qualifying the past participle of the verb “suspect”. It is for the tribunal of fact trying the charge to consider whether the property in question may be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. By contrast, s26 of the <em>Summary Offences Act </em>requires an actual reasonable suspicion by the person laying the charge. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;The characteristics of s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 resemble those of s527C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and are identical to those of s82 of the <em>Proceeds of Crime Act </em>1987 (Cth). They do not resemble those of s26 of the <em>Summary Offences </em>Act 1966. <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In order to make out the offence created by s123(1) of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 the prosecution must prove that the accused performed one of the acts prohibited by the section in respect of property which may reasonably be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. It is for the tribunal of fact, in this case a Magistrate, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the elements of the offence. Procedurally, the prosecutor would need to establish a prima facie case in the ordinary way before the accused could be required to enter upon his defence; which defences might include, in an appropriate case, reliance upon the statutory defence provided by s123(2). <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Section 82 of the <em>Proceeds of Crime Act </em>1987 (Cth) is, drafting differences aside, in virtually identical terms to s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997. The only material difference is that the word “Victoria” in the Victorian Act is replaced by the word “Australia” in the Commonwealth Act. That section has been interpreted as requiring the tribunal of fact (usually a jury) to be satisfied as to each of the elements constituting the offence. In <em>R v Zotti</em>[21] the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia held that on the facts of that case the prosecution had to prove, first, that the appellant had disposed of money and secondly, that that money may reasonably be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. The Court relied upon the cases to which I have referred and <em>Anderson v Judges of District Court </em>(NSW)[22] and <em>R v Buckett</em>[23]. In each of those cases the Court made it clear that it was not the suspicion of the investigator that was relevant, but rather whether the tribunal of fact was satisfied that the relevant property may be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;For the reasons which I have set out I respectfully differ from the view of s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 of the Chief Justice as to the nature of the test of reasonable suspicion and of Kellam J in <em>Rinaldi v Watts</em>[24] as to the necessity for there to be contemporaneity between the possession of the relevant property and the reasonable suspicion that it may be the proceeds of crime. Thus the approach of the Magistrate in this case was wrong as a matter of law. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate in this case dismissed the charge against the respondent by applying the reasoning in <em>Bodouloh </em>to the prosecution case. In particular, she held that there was no evidence of the subjective suspicion of the informant that the money found on Pastras was the proceeds of crime (as required by <em>Bodouloh</em>) and that, even if there was, there was no evidence that such a suspicion was reasonable. She held that the police officers in fact suspected that the money was to be used by Pastras to pay Lewis Moran for drugs and that that suspicion was reasonable. Thus, applying the law as laid down in <em>Bodouloh </em>the Magistrate reached the appropriate conclusion. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;Had the Magistrate applied the law as I have expressed it she would have considered the no case submission by the respondent by asking the question whether on the evidence as it stood at the end of the prosecution case there was evidence upon which Pastras could lawfully be convicted of being in possession of a sum of money which may be suspected of being proceeds of crime.[25] This is a question of law. <br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;There is no question that there was ample evidence of Pastras’ possession of the sum of money. A number of police officers deposed to that fact. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;The question of whether there was evidence upon which a tribunal of fact could find that the money may be suspected of being the proceeds of crime depends upon inferences being drawn from the evidence before the Court. There was evidence that Pastras was in possession of a large sum of money, that it was secreted on his body, that he had been unemployed for a year or so and was in receipt of sickness benefits, that he had no other assets, had not recently sold anything and that he was at the home of a known drug dealer who, on some occasions at least, did business on credit. Might not those facts lead one to a conclusion that the money may be suspected as being the proceeds of crime? That there might be other hypotheses consistent with its not being such proceeds is not to the point: <em>R v Tween</em>[26]. Giving full weight to the qualifier “may” and the fact that a suspicion is a state of conjecture or surmise when proof is lacking[27] I consider the evidence would support a finding that the money may be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. Of course, the suspicion must be reasonable; that is to say not capricious or lacking some logical basis. It may reasonably be suspected here that Pastras had bought drugs from Moran on an earlier occasion on credit, had sold them and was about to pay his debt with the proceeds of such sales or part of such proceeds. There would be nothing unreasonable about such a conclusion and it is certainly not precluded by the probability that Pastras was going to use the money to pay Moran for drugs. That proceeds of crime would themselves become proceeds of crime a second time in such a scenario is not to the point. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;The level of proof the prosecution must maintain to establish a prima facie case of a breach of s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 is a much qualified one. It has been met in this case. The respondent has a case to answer. Whether he will be convicted will depend upon whether the Magistrate is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of the elements of the offence after the respondent has made his defence to the charge whether by relying on s123(2) or otherwise. It was not open to the Magistrate applying the law as I have found it to be to the evidence led before her to find that Pastras had no case to answer. Accordingly, the appeal will be upheld and the matter remitted to the Magistrate to be further dealt with according to law.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] Part 14 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997 which contained s123 has now been repealed by the <em>Crimes (Money Laundering) Act </em>2003. The repealing Act enacted s195 of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 which, although differently drafted, would appear to create a similar, if perhaps wider, offence to s123 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>1997. <br />[2] (2003) 144 A Crim R 37 <br />[3] (2002) 82 SASR 554; 131 A Crim R 27 <br />[4] (1995) 132 ALR 669; 79 A Crim R 302 <br />[5] (1983) 2 VR 499 at 506 quoting Street CJ in <em>R v Abbrederis </em>(1981) 1 NSWLR 530 at 542. <br />[6] (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492 <br />[7] [1995] 1 Qd&nbsp;R 623; (1994) 71 A Crim R 586 <br />[8] (2003) 138 A Crim R 456 <br />[9] (2002) 82 SASR 554; 131 A Crim R 27 <br />[10] (1995) 132 ALR 669; 79 A Crim R 302 <br />[11] (1919) 26 CLR 265 <br />[12] [1911] VLR 133 at 135 <br />[13] [1908] VLR 645 <br />[14] [1920] VLR 331 <br />[15] [1923] VLR 556 per McArthur J <br />[16] (1919) 26 CLR 265 <br />[17] (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 351 <br />[18] (1989) 17 NSWLR 149; 44 A Crim R 273 <br />[19] [1976] 1 NSWLR 111 <br />[20] [1981] 1 NSWLR 530 <br />[21] (2002) 82 SASR 554; 131 A Crim R 27 <br />[22] (1992) 27 NSWLR 701 at 714 per Kirby P <br />[23] (1995) 132 ALR 669; 79 A Crim R 302 <br />[24] (2003) 138 A Crim R 456 <br />[25] <em>May v O’Sullivan </em>(1955) 92 CLR 654 <br />[26] [1965] VR 687 per Sholl J at 693 <br />[27] <em>George v Rockett </em>(1990) 170 CLR 104 at 115.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the Appellant DPP: Mr D Gurvich, counsel.

Where there were no real concerns that a person in custody might access and dissipate the property the subject of the application, notice of the application should be given to the person who has an interest in the property.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />GILLARD J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;This is a return of an application brought under s16 of the Confiscation Act 1997 ("the Act") seeking a restraining order against Mr Tien Duc Vu ("Mr Vu"). <br /><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>The application is brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of Victoria ("DPP"). It was filed yesterday. In support of the application is an affidavit sworn by Paul Adam Stow, sworn 20 June 2006. <br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The application is made pursuant to Part 2 of the Act. By reason of s16(1)(a), the DPP may apply without notice to any person who may have an interest in the property the subject of the application. The DPP seeks to make the application without notice to the said Mr Vu. It is alleged that he has an interest in a sum of cash. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Two members of the Court of Appeal in the proceeding <em>Navarolli v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic)</em>[1] held that as a general rule, it was necessary to give notice to any person who may have an interest in the property. Before considering that case, it is necessary to state further historical facts concerning this application. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;This is the second application made by the DPP in respect of property in which Mr Vu is alleged to have an interest. The property is identified in the application as $24,235 cash. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The earlier application was filed on 20 June 2006. In support of the application was the affidavit of Paul Adam Stow sworn that day. The DPP relies on the same affidavit in the present application. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;The application came on before Dodds-Streeton J on 21 June 2006. Senior counsel appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Apparently, in the course of discussion before her Honour the question arose as to whether the Court of Appeal decision in Navarolli required that the applicant give notice to any person whom the Court had reason to believe had an interest in the property pursuant to s17(1) of the Act. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Apparently, her Honour was of the view that if the application wished to proceed it would be necessary to give notice to Mr Vu by reason of the decision in <em>Navarolli</em>. Evidently, counsel for the applicant informed the Court that if it was necessary to give notice then the applicant would not proceed with the application. As a result her Honour dismissed the application. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;By summons filed 26 June 2006, the applicant sought leave to appeal from her Honour’s order. The matter came on before Ashley and Redlich JJA on 30 June 2006. Some doubts were raised by the judges as to whether leave should be granted in the circumstances, bearing in mind that the application had been dismissed because the applicant did not wish to proceed, and after the judge had indicated she would require that notice be given to Mr Vu. It was clear from the affidavit filed in support of the application that the Director of Public Prosecutions was anxious that the Appeal Court should reconsider the decision in <em>Navarolli</em>.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;I interpolate to observe that application was made for leave to appeal to the High Court against the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Navarolli</em>, but the High Court refused special leave on 16 June 2006 because it was considered that the <em>Navarolli </em>case was not a suitable vehicle for leave. However, I am led to believe that some doubts were raised by the learned members of the High Court concerning the correctness of the Court of Appeal decision.<br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;Apparently, because of the doubts expressed by the two Appeal Judges on the application for leave to appeal against the order made by Dodds-Streeton J, the present application has been made seeking a further order. I interpolate to observe that the Court of Appeal ordered that the application for leave to appeal against her Honour’s order be heard and determined together with the proposed appeal.<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;In the present application the Director of Public Prosecutions seeks a restraining order <em>ex parte</em>. The question arises whether the Court should require that notice be given to Mr Vu as the person who has an interest in the property.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The effect of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Navarolli </em>is that as a general rule, notice must be given to any person who may have an interest in the property sought to be restrained by the order. It is a general rule. It may be departed from in appropriate circumstances. <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;I have difficulty with the reasoning in the Court of Appeal decision of <em>Navarolli</em>.[2] I was in fact the judge at first instance who ruled that the Director was not obliged to give notice to Mr Navarolli, and I made an order ex parte pursuant to s18 of the Act. Section 18 requires the Court to make an order if it is satisfied of certain matters. In <em>DPP v Navarolli</em>,[3] I carefully analysed the provisions of Part 2 relating to an application for a restraining order under the Act. I held that the DPP had a statutory right to apply without notice for a restraining order, and the Court had power in an appropriate case under s17(1) to require the applicant to give notice to any person whom the Court had reason to believe had an interest in the property. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Two judges of the Court of Appeal disagreed with my approach. The Court criticised my conclusion[4] because it was said that my reasoning overlooked what Dixon CJ and Webb J said in <em>The Commissioner of Police v Tanos</em>[5] about the "deep rooted principle of law that before any one can be punished or prejudiced in his person or property by any judicial or quasi judicial proceeding he must be afforded an adequate opportunity of being heard." <br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;The reason why no mention was made to that well-known principle is, first, because counsel did not refer to the well-established and well-known principle that as a general rule, no order should be made against any person affecting his or her rights without giving that person an opportunity to be heard, unless there were circumstances justifying such a course. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;This principle is well-known to all members of this Court and, in particular, those who sit regularly in the Practice Court and deal with applications made ex parte. In some areas of the law, it is necessary to make orders ex parte to avoid the risk of injury or damage to the applicant. Classic examples are a Mareva injunction and an Anton Piller order. Any judge, when dealing with an ex parte application, raises the question of whether notice should be given. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The second reason why I did not refer to that principle was because in my view, the statutory jurisdiction which is given to this Court under Part 2 expressly deals with the question of an ex parte application being made and the requirement that the Court may require notice to be given under s17(1). Indeed, I approached the question on that basis. <br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;In the <em>Tanos </em>case, Dixon CJ and Webb J,[6] after stating the principle set out above, went on to say this:<br />"In <em>Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works</em>, Byles J said that a long course of authority established ‘that, although there are no positive words in a statute requiring that a party shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature’."<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;I interpolate to observe that this statute did address in positive words the requirement of notice in certain circumstances. There were express words in the statute.<br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Their Honours then went on to say this, which was not referred to by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal:<br />"It is hardly necessary to add that its application to proceedings in the established courts is a matter of course, <u>but the rule is subject to a sufficient indication of an intention of the legislature to the contrary</u>. Such an intention is not to be assumed, nor is it to be spelled out from indirect references, uncertain inferences or equivocal considerations. The intention must satisfactorily appear from expressed words of plain intendment."[7] <br />(Emphasis added).<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;As is clear from what their Honours said in that case, the requirement to give notice is often implied into statutory provisions, but where the Legislature expressly deals with the situation, then the Court is not concerned with the implied obligations under the common law, but is concerned with the intention of the Legislature. The Confiscation Act dealt with the very matter. Its application depended upon the intention of Parliament, the primary source of which was the words of the Act. The Act prescribes the conditions of the exercise of the jurisdiction.<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;It is interesting to observe that in the Tanos case, a regulation was made dealing with an ex parte application. And their Honours said in relation to that regulation, which did empower a judge to hear it <em>ex parte</em>:<br />"This regulation may perhaps be read as leaving the choice of courses at large to the judge. But it ought not so to be interpreted. It should be understood as meaning that prima facie the course provided for in paragraph (ii) should be followed, and only in exceptional or special cases should an immediate declaration be made. The analogy is that of an interim injunction, but the caution should be greater because the declaration, unless it is framed as provisional or conditional concludes the right subject to rescission."<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;It is noted that the authority to hear a matter ex parte was given in the regulations. But as the High Court made clear, there may be certain circumstances which demand that the matter should not proceed ex parte, especially as the effect of the application was drastic. <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;The <em>Tanos </em>case should be read very closely. It concerned a declaration being made under the <em>Disorderly Houses Act </em>of New South Wales. As their Honours said:[8]<br />"The effect of the declaration while it is in force is somewhat drastic."<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Their Honours then pointed out that once the declaration was made, it was published in the gazette, twice published in a newspaper circulating in the neighbourhood, and was to be served on the owner and the occupier of the premises. It was to be affixed, if necessary, on the premises, and the consequences of the declaration fell under four heads. Their Honours’ description of "somewhat drastic" was understated. That is not the case here. The case here is concerned with a freezing order and not a confiscation order. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Each State of the Commonwealth of Australia and England has similar legislation to the <em>Confiscation Act</em>. In England, the jurisdiction is described as "a criminal Mareva." See <em>Jennings v Crown Prosecution Service</em>.[9] In that case, reference was made to what the former Master of the Rolls had stated with respect to the difference between a restraining order and a confiscation order. They do fulfil different functions. What I am concerned with today, and what I was concerned with in the Navarolli case, is a restraining order. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;Lord Donaldson MR said <em>In re Peters</em>:[10]<br />"Counsel for the Commissioners points out that a court faced with the making or variation of a restraint order, or to a charging order is not concerned with the making of a confiscation order or a process of execution in satisfaction of such an order. It is concerned solely with the preservation of assets at a time when it cannot know whether the accused will or will not be convicted. Such jurisdiction is closely analogous to that exercised by the courts in relation to Mareva injunctions and might, not inaccurately, be referred to as a ‘drugs Act Mareva.’"<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;I interpolate to observe that there was some discussion in the case of <em>Jennings v Crown Prosecution Service</em>, <em>supra</em>, about matters being heard ex parte, and I refer to what Laws LJ said at p198. The English position seems to be consistent with what in my respectful submission is a very obvious commonsense approach. The application seeks a freezing order and nothing more, and in most cases, for very obvious reasons, will be heard <em>ex parte</em>. <br /><strong>30.</strong>&nbsp;The fact is that the initial application under Part 2 results in a freezing order. Of course that interferes with the rights of the true owner to deal with property, but it is on a temporary basis. Any person affected by the order would have a right at common law to return to the Court promptly and seek to be heard in respect to the ex parte order. And in regard to that observation, I refer to what Taylor J said in the <em>Tanos </em>case.[11] But in addition, s20 of the Act gives to a person claiming an interest in the property the right to apply to the Court for an order under the following sections, and if the person who claims an interest satisfies the Court in respect to a number of matters, then the Court may make an order excluding the property from the operation of the restraining order. The first order that is made is very similar to an interim Mareva order and merely freezes dealing with the property in any way. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;An important factor when considering an application to hear it ex parte is whether notice to the person who may have an interest in the property might result in the property being removed and dealt with in some way, thereby devaluing it or putting it beyond the reach of the authorities. <br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Paragraph 40 summarises the reasons of the Court of Appeal in <em>Navarolli </em>as follows:<br />"It follows in our view that His Honour’s exercise of discretion miscarried when he refused to require the Director under s17(1) to give notice of the application. His Honour fell into error in regarding the statute and creating what amounted to a presumption against the giving of notice, or as imposing on a person in <em>Navarolli’s </em>position the onus of showing why he should be given notice. His Honour failed to consider the fundamental natural justice principle to which we have referred. For the reasons given that principle meant that <em>Navarolli</em> had a right to be heard, unless there was some compelling reason for that to be denied to him."<br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;I may say I am unaware of any case that requires notice or has considered the question in a criminal Mareva. I did not say that the statute created what amounted to a presumption against the giving of notice. What I did say, and made very clear, was that s16(1)(a) gave the right to the DPP to apply without notice for a restraining order. That is clear from the terms of the sub-section. What I then went on to consider was whether or not it was appropriate in the circumstances of that case for the Court to require an applicant to give notice under s17(1) to any person who had an interest in the property. <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;In my view, the principles of natural justice played no part in the consideration. It was a matter for the judge hearing the application and the exercise of his discretion to determine whether notice should be given. It is not a question of calling upon the person with an interest to argue or submit that notice should be given. In the particular circumstances in <em>Navarolli</em>, the person who had an interest in the property actually had notice of the application, was present in court when it was made and sought to be heard. But in the usual run of the mill case, that person will not be present for the very obvious reason that the Director seeks to make an application <em>ex parte </em>to avoid any loss of property. <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;However, having said all that, clearly the Court of Appeal decision binds me. Accordingly, I must give effect to it. <br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;As the Court stated, whilst as a general proposition a person who may have had an interest in the property had a right to be heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice, the right to be heard could be denied if there was "some compelling reason for that to be denied to him."<br /><strong>37.</strong>&nbsp;A matter of some importance is the question of what a person who has an interest in the property can do on an application such as the present. The Court must be satisfied of the matters set out in s18 of the Act. Indeed, the Court is obliged to make an order if those matters are proven. In any event, the application to be excluded from the restraining order places the onus upon the person the subject of the restraining order, to prove certain matters before the Court would exclude his interest in the property. <br /><strong>38.</strong>&nbsp;I have read the affidavit of Paul Adam Stow. In my opinion, the matters set out in s18 are proven by the contents of the affidavit. The question then arises whether or not notice should be given to the said Mr Vu, as a person having an interest in the property. <br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;The affidavit reveals that on 12 January 2005, Mr Vu was arrested. At the time, he had ten grams of heroin in his possession and $3,380 cash. On the execution of a search warrant as his home at 10 Cherry Avenue, Altona North, 56 grams of heroin and $20,855 in cash were located and seized. The applicant now has control over the money. <br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;On 24 April 2006, Mr Vu pleaded guilty to trafficking of a commercial quantity of heroin and was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. The sentence is currently under appeal. He is at present an inmate of a prison. The basis of the application is for an order to restrain him dealing with the cash, and the purpose of the order is to satisfy any forfeiture order that may be made under the <em>Confiscation Act</em>, to satisfy any automatic forfeiture that may occur, or to satisfy any pecuniary penalty order. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;One thing is very clear. There is no question of Mr Vu getting his hands on the cash, and hence any fears he may do anything to deal with the cash are indeed extremely remote. He is presently in prison. He is unaware of this application this day. His solicitors have written to the DPP and requested that the cash be refunded. The letter was received on 12 July 2006. <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;The question then arises as to whether or not he should be given notice of the application. Because there are no real concerns about Mr Vu getting his hands on the money and dissipating it, and following the decision of the Court of Appeal, it is my opinion that notice of this application must be given to the person who has an interest, Mr Vu.<br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;Accordingly, I order as follows. <br />1. That the applicant, the Director of Public Prosecutions of Victoria, give notice of this application for a restraining order under s16 of the <em>Confiscation Act </em>(1997) to Mr Vu, pursuant to s17(1) of the Act. <br />2. That the application be adjourned.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] [2005] VSCA 323. <br />[2] Supra. <br />[3] [2005] VSC 395. <br />[4] See paragraph 29. <br />[5] (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 395. <br />[6] At p395. <br />[7] At p396. <br />[8] At 391. <br />[9] (2006) 1 WLR 182 at 199. <br />[10] [1988] QB 871 at 879. <br />[11] supra, at p397.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the plaintiff DPP (Vic): Dr G Griffith QC with Mr SG O''Bryan SC, counsel.

After service of the hand up brief, H. served a notice on the prosecution that he wished to cross-examine at the committal proceeding a number of police witnesses. The magistrate granted leave in respect of some witnesses but refused leave in respect of 18 police officers and two other witnesses. Among other reasons, the magistrate stated that issues with respect to whether cash had been stolen by police at the scene and their spending habits were not matters relevant to the prosecutions not to the credit of the witnesses. H.then sought orders in the nature of mandamus and other orders.<br /><br /><strong>HELD: Application for an order in the nature of mandamus refused.<br />1.&nbsp;A precondition of the existence of any authority to make an order simply means in the current context that the court has no authority to grant leave to cross-examine a witness unless satisfied of the matters set out in the <em>Magistrates'' Court Act </em>1989 clause 13(5)(a) and (b), namely, identification of an issue, relevance of a witness’ evidence to that issue and justification of cross-examination of that witness on that issue. An incorrect decision by the Magistrates’ Court on those matters does not necessarily mean that there has been jurisdictional error. <br />2.&nbsp;The submission that the magistrate erred in deciding that the issues with respect to the cash or the provenance of the items found did not amount to a constructive refusal by the magistrate to exercise jurisdiction. The question was whether the magistrate failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on him or so misconceived the nature and extent of the jurisdiction that his purported exercise of the jurisdiction was in truth no exercise at all.<br /><br />HABERSBERGER J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;By an originating motion filed on 10 August 2004 the plaintiff John William Henderson sought prerogative relief in respect of the refusal by a magistrate to grant leave to Mr Henderson to cross-examine 18 witnesses at a committal proceeding. Although orders in the nature of <em>certiorari</em>, declarations and an order in the nature of mandamus were sought in the originating motion, Mr Gillespie-Jones of counsel who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff before me, informed me that the only relief sought by him was an order in the nature of mandamus requiring the first defendant, the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria, to hear and determine the matter according to law. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Henderson has been charged with a number of offences including having been in possession of and trafficking cannabis L, heroin and amphetamines; being in possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives; receiving and being in possession of proceeds of crime. The charges followed the execution of a search warrant at a house at 7 Burton Crescent, Maribyrnong. Mr Henderson was one of a number of people present in that house at the time of the search. It is alleged that drugs were found at the house in different locations. Many of the goods were found at two storage premises allegedly linked to Mr Henderson.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Henderson was served with a hand-up brief and the committal proceeding involving Mr Henderson and two other defendants is due to commence next Monday, 13 December 2004. Pursuant to s56 of the <em>Magistrates'' Court Act </em>1989 “a committal proceeding must be conducted in accordance with Schedule 5” of that Act. Schedule 5 relevantly provides that a witness who has made a statement, a copy of which was served in the hand-up brief, cannot be cross-examined without leave (clause 13(2)). A defendant who wishes to seek leave to cross-examine at the committal proceeding a specified person or persons must give notice of that fact no later than 14 days before the committal mention date (clause 12(1)(a)). Because of their importance clause 13(5) and (5A) of Schedule 5 should be quoted in full:<br />“(5) The Court must not grant leave to cross-examine a witness to whom this clause applies unless satisfied that—<br />(a) the defendant has identified an issue to which the proposed questioning relates and has provided a reason why the evidence of the witness is relevant to that issue; and <br />(b) cross-examination of the witness on that issue is justified. <br />(5A) In determining whether cross-examination is justified the Court must have regard to the need to ensure that—<br />(a) the prosecution case is adequately disclosed; and <br />(b) the issues are adequately defined; and <br />(c) the evidence is of sufficient weight to support a conviction for the offence with which the defendant is charged; and <br />(d) a fair trial will take place if the matter proceeds to trial, including that the defendant is able adequately to prepare and present a defence; and <br />(e) matters relevant to a potential plea of guilty are clarified; and <br />(f) matters relevant to a potential nolle prosequi are clarified; and <br />(g) trivial, vexatious or oppressive cross-examination is not permitted; and <br />(h) the interests of justice are otherwise served.”<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;By a form 8A dated 29 June 2004 Mr Henderson gave notice that he intended to seek leave to cross-examine a large number of witnesses. In respect of 18 named police officers, the notice stated as follows: <br />“The issue that the above witnesses have in common is that they executed a search warrant at 7 Burton Crescent, Maribyrnong and are said to have found items including firearms and drugs during the search. A very large amount of cash was taken during the search and has not been reported as being found and it is proposed to cross-examine the above in relation to any change in spending habits after the execution of the search warrant to ascertain which police have taken the money and not reported it. The premises were the subject of telephone intercept and surveillance and it will be necessary to explore these matters with particularity in order to establish the police knowledge of cash on the premises. It is sought to examine the provenance of the items found. Credit as to previous complaints against the above members will also be a matter in issue. In situations were items have been found or planted credit is a major issue. The telephone intercepts and logs have been the subject subpoena [sic] served upon the Chief Commissioner months ago but no documents have been produced. It is sought to examine the police members as to access to the storage facilities videos [sic] thereof, and any similar facts alleged arising from the burglaries. Access to the storage facilities and the contents of them at various times is also an issue. It is difficult to identify which policeman touches any particular issue as the logs and recordings have not been produced pursuant to subpoena or otherwise”.<br />Other issues were raised in respect of 20 other witnesses.<br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;By a form 9A dated 8 July 2004 the Director of Public Prosecutions gave notice that the informant opposed leave being granted to Mr Henderson to cross-examine 21 of the 38 witnesses, including all 18 of the police officers. The reasons for opposing leave were stated to be as follows:<br />“George Xydias - this witness’s evidence does not relate to an indictable offence, to which the committal proceedings apply. Raymond Vincent and Alan Pringle - the issue is said to be the provenance of the weapons or items - these witnesses are not the appropriate witnesses with respect to this issue”.<br />Then in respect of the 18 police officers it was said:<br />“The issue of the alleged missing money is (a) not relevant to a fact in issue; (b) is merely a collateral issue and does not bear any weight or have any relevance to the charges as filed; (c) does not relate to the credit of the police officers given that the evidence relating to the charges is corroborated by electronic evidence”.<br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;On 9 July 2004 the parties came before the Magistrates’ Court on a committal mention. All three accused were represented, as was the informant and the Chief Commissioner of Police. The Chief Commissioner had been subpoenaed to produce certain documents. A folder of documents was provided to Mr Henderson’s counsel on that day and arrangements made for other documents to be made available for inspection.<br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;All three accused had given notices of intention to seek leave to cross-examine. There was no objection to orders being made granting leave to the other two accused to cross-examine the witnesses named in each of their notices, in respect of the issues identified in each notice. Counsel for Mr Henderson informed the learned magistrate that as a result, leave had been given to cross-examine 11 of the 18 police officers named by Mr Henderson. Of course, that leave only related to the issues identified by each of the other accused persons. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Submissions were then made by counsel on behalf of Mr Henderson and on behalf of the informant. Counsel for Mr Henderson referred to the allegation that a large amount of cash had been taken during the search and disputed the reasons given for the lack of relevance of the alleged missing money. He also submitted that the notice of opposition did not give any reasons for opposing the calling of the 18 police officers in respect of a number of other relevant matters. Submissions were also made about the other three witnesses in respect of whom the granting of leave was opposed. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;In response, submissions were made on behalf of the informant including that the poor drafting of the notice given by Mr Henderson meant that the requirements of clause 13(5) of Schedule 5 had not been addressed.<br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Henderson declined the suggestion by the learned magistrate to adjourn the application for leave to cross-examine until after there had been an opportunity to read through all of the new material obtained through the subpoena process. <br /><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong>After considering the matter over the luncheon adjournment, the learned magistrate gave his reasons for refusing leave to cross-examine in respect of the 18 police officers and two of the other witnesses, and for granting leave to cross-examine in respect of the remaining witness. The relevant part of his reasons read as follows: <br />“In determining whether to grant leave to cross-examine I must have regard to the matters set out in clause 13(5)(a) of Schedule 5. With respect to the first group of witnesses set out in the form 8A, that is some 18 witnesses, the reference to the reason to cross-examine relating to telephone intercepts and logs and the following lines set out in that particular paragraph have been the subject of a subpoena to the Chief Commissioner of Police. Significant documents have this day been produced under subpoena and others are to be produced on behalf of the Chief [Commissioner] to counsel for Mr Henderson. Accordingly, the subpoena on the Chief Commissioner is and will be adjourned to a date to be fixed with a right of reinstatement. Consequently, those issues at this stage, in my view, do not warrant leave for any cross-examination to be granted. The other grounds on which leave is being sought to cross-examine these initially named 18 witnesses, in my view, do not fall within the requirement of clause 5(a). The issues with respect to the cash, spending habits of the police, the provenance of the items found and the police knowledge of such are not matters relevant to these prosecutions, nor do they go to the credit of the witnesses, having regard to the electronic devices and other evidence which is contained in the brief. With respect to the first 18 witnesses named, the reasons and issues set out in the form 8A do not, in my view, meet the necessary criteria of clause 5(a) and accordingly, the application to cross-examine those witnesses is refused.”<br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;Following the commencement of this proceeding on 10 August 2004 the Office of Public Prosecutions wrote to Mr Henderson’s solicitors on 30 August 2004. Part of that letter stated as follows: <br />“I advise that it is our view that these proceedings are misconceived. We submit that pursuant to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Potter v Tural </em>(2000) 2 VR 612, the Magistrates [sic] decision is not reviewable. I advise that the Co-defendants, Warwick and McMahon were granted Leave to cross-examine most of the witnesses concerned. This was because they provided valid reasons in their respective Forms 8A. Copies of those forms are attached.<br />We submit that the appropriate course for you to follow is to re-submit an amended Form 8A containing valid reasons and make a fresh Application at a further Committal Mention. We would not oppose having the matter listed for a further mention for this purpose.”<br /><strong>13.&nbsp;</strong>In late September, Mr Henderson’s solicitors apparently sent to the Office of Public Prosecutions an undated and unsigned Amended Notice to Cross-Examine. Each of the 18 police officers was now listed separately together with a statement of the issue or issues in respect of which leave to cross-examine was sought and a statement of the relevance of that evidence. The issue of the “very large amount of cash” allegedly taken during the search is said to be relevant to the cross-examination of all bar two of the police officers. A typical example of the way in which the new notice is drafted is that relating to Craig Smith which reads as follows: <br />“Issue: The location and positioning of exhibits at the 7 Burton Crescent Maribyrnong [sic]. The bias of police members involved in the search. The attendance at Public Self Storage on 25th March 2004. Relevance: This witness attended at 7 Burton Crescent Maribyrnong on the execution of a search warrant. He unlocked a safe in the house. He was in company with Allan Birch and Paul Hendricks. A very large amount of cash was taken during the search and has not been reported as being found, and it is proposed to cross-examine the above in relation to any change in spending habits after the execution of the search warrant to ascertain which police have taken the money and not reported it. It is sought to examine the provenance of the items found. The bias of any investigation is relevant. The connection of items at Public Self-Storage to the defendant.”<br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;In addition, the Amended Notice to Cross-Examine included the name of a nineteenth police officer, Brett Williamson, in it. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;By a letter dated 28 September 2004 the Office of Public Prosecutions acknowledge receipt of the Amended Notice. That letter went on to say as follows: <br />“An Amended Form 8A, which is undated, was delivered by hand to this office on the 27th September 2004 for Mr Adrian Castle. There was no covering letter by way of explanation. With reference to the request for the police members, I note that the Amended Form 8A again makes reference to the issue of the alleged missing money. This is an issue which has already been canvassed and opposed by this Office and then the Court when considering the first Form 8A on the 9th July 2004. Whilst this remains an issue as well as reference to bias of any investigation drafted in the Form 8A, there is no need for a Special Mention to be listed in the Magistrates’ Court. The proceedings issued in the Supreme Court can be persued [sic] to resolve the issue ...”<br /><strong>16.</strong>&nbsp;No attempt was made to obtain a committal mention by Mr Henderson’s legal representatives. Mr Gillespie-Jones explained that this was because the Office of Public Prosecutions had indicated that it still opposed any attempt to cross-examine on the issue of the alleged missing money.<br /><strong>17.&nbsp;</strong>I turn then to consider the principles governing the granting of an order in the nature of mandamus in circumstances such as this. First, mandamus may go where there has been an error which amounts to a refusal, whether actual or constructive, to exercise jurisdiction at all.[1<br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;Secondly, the meaning of a constructive refusal to exercise jurisdiction has been authoritatively explained in the following passages. In <em>The King v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal &amp; Anor, Ex parte Bott</em>[2] Rich, Dixon and McTiernan JJ said:<br />“A writ of mandamus does not issue except to command the fulfillment of some duty of a public nature which remains unperformed. If the person under the duty professes to perform it, but what he actually does amounts in law to no performance because he has misconceived his duty or, in the course of attempting to discharge it, has failed to comply with some requirement essential to its valid or effectual performance, he may be commanded by the writ to execute his function according to law <em>de novo</em>, at any rate if a sufficient demand or request to do so has been made upon him. In the case of a tribunal, whether of a judicial or an administrative nature, charged by law with the duty of ascertaining or determining facts upon which rights depend, if it has undertaken the inquiry and announced a conclusion, the prosecutor who seeks a writ of mandamus must show that the ostensible determination is not a real performance of the duty imposed by law upon the tribunal. It may be shown that the members of the tribunal have not applied themselves to the question which the law prescribes, or that in purporting to decide it they have in truth been actuated by extraneous considerations, or that in some other respect they have so proceeded that the determination is nugatory and void.”<br />In <em>Ex parte Hebburn Limited, re Kearsley Shire Council</em>[3], Jordan CJ said: <br />“It was contended, however, that even if this be so, at the worst all that the magistrate had done was to make a mistake of law in construing the section, and the fact that a tribunal has made such a mistake in exercising its jurisdiction, does not amount in law to a constructive failure to exercise it. I quite agree that the mere fact that a tribunal has made a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction of a statute, does not necessarily constitute a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction, <em>R v Minister of Health</em>. But there are mistakes and mistakes; and if a mistake of law as to the proper construction of a statute investing a tribunal with jurisdiction leads it to misunderstand the nature of the jurisdiction which it is to exercise, and to apply ‘a wrong and inadmissible test’: <em>Estate and Trust Agencies (1927) Ltd v Singapore Improvement Trust</em>, or to ‘misconceive its duty’, or ‘not to apply itself to the question which the law prescribes’: <em>R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal</em>, or to misunderstand ‘the nature of the opinion which it is to form’: <em>R v Connell</em>, in giving a decision in exercise of its jurisdiction or authority, a decision so given would be regarded as given in a purported and not a real exercise of jurisdiction, leaving the jurisdiction in law constructively unexercised, and the tribunal liable to the issue of a prerogative writ of mandamus to hear and determine the matter according to law: <em>R v Board of Education</em>.” [References omitted]<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;Thirdly, the correctness or otherwise of the magistrate’s refusal of the application for leave to cross-examine is not the question to be considered in determining whether or an order in the nature of mandamus is called for. Thus, immediately after the passage from <em>Bott’s </em>case just quoted, Rich, Dixon and McTiernan JJ continued: <br />“... the prosecutor who undertakes to establish that a tribunal has so acted ought not to be permitted under colour of doing so to enter upon an examination of the correctness of the tribunal’s decision, or of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting it, or of the weight of the evidence against it, or of the regularity or irregularity of the manner in which the tribunal has proceeded. The correctness or incorrectness of the conclusion reached by the tribunal is entirely beside the question whether a writ of mandamus lies”.<br />See also <em>Potter v Tural</em>[4] and <em>Tez v Longley</em>[5].<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;Fourthly, the granting of this type of relief remains discretionary.[6] <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Gillespie-Jones submitted that in attempting to discharge his duty the magistrate failed to comply with a “requirement essential to its valid or effective performance” and failed in “the duty of ascertaining or determining facts upon which rights depend”, thus the “ostensible determination is not a real performance of the duty imposed by law upon the tribunal.” He submitted that there had been a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.<br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;In support of his argument that there had been a jurisdictional error in this case, Mr Gillespie-Jones placed great reliance on a passage from the judgment of Batt JA in <em>Potter v Tural</em>[7]. I quote from His Honour’s judgment:<br />“To determine whether either of the magistrates constructively failed or refused to exercise jurisdiction it is necessary to ascertain the task which was confided to them by the relevant legislation. This question of statutory interpretation is that which is determinative of Ground 1A. In my opinion, the task confided was simply to determine, (1) whether the magistrate was satisfied that the evidence sought to be adduced had substantial relevance to the facts in issue and also, where a witness was under the age of 18 years, whether the interests of justice could not be adequately served except by granting leave; and, if the magistrate was so satisfied, (2) whether leave should be granted to cross-examine as proposed in the notice of intention, that is, whether such cross-examination should be allowed. This follows in my view from cll 4(1)(c), 12(1)(a), 13(2) and (4) and 16(a) and (b). Clause 4(1)(c) appears to be an express grant of jurisdiction to entertain and decide an application for leave. When sub cl (5) mandatorily requires the court to ‘have regard to’ the matters enumerated there, it requires the court to take those matters into account and give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its determination. But the subclause does not go to jurisdiction by serving to delimit it with certain tests. Rather, it states criteria or considerations that are obligatory in making the determination confided to the court. If a magistrate granted leave without having had regard even tacitly, to consideration (a) for instance, he would not, in my opinion, have failed to exercise jurisdiction (or acted without jurisdiction), but would have made an error within jurisdiction. Unlike the satisfaction required by sub cl (4), the Act does not require the considerations enumerated in cl 13(5) to be taken into account ‘as a pre-condition of the existence of any authority to make an order or decision in the circumstances of the particular case’. Nor in my opinion, if the Magistrates’ Court misconstrues cl 13(5) can it be said that it ‘thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case’. Rather, I consider the following passage from the judgment of the High Court in <em>Craig </em>is applicable, namely: - “In contrast [to a tribunal], the ordinary jurisdiction of a court of law, encompasses authority to decide questions of law, as well as questions of fact, involved in matters which it has jurisdiction to determine. The identification of relevant issues, the formulation of relevant questions and the determination of what is and what is not relevant evidence are all routine steps in the discharge of that ordinary jurisdiction. Demonstrable mistake in the identification of such issues or the formulation of such questions will commonly involve error of law which may, if an appeal is available and is pursued, be corrected .... Such a mistake on the part of an inferior court entrusted with authority to identify, formulate and determine such issues and questions will not however, ordinarily constitute jurisdictional error. Similarly, a failure by an inferior court to take into account some matter which it was, as a matter of law, required to take into account in determining a question within jurisdiction or reliance by such a court upon some irrelevant matter upon which it was, as a matter of law, not entitled to rely in determining such a question will not ordinarily involve jurisdictional error”. That was said in relation to <em>certiorari</em>. The position must be no less clear in relation to mandamus for failure to exercise jurisdiction”.<br />Mr Gillespie-Jones argued that this statement by Batt JA meant that any error in applying clause 13(4), the predecessor of what is now clause 13(5) in Schedule 5, was a jurisdictional error. I do not agree. A precondition of the existence of any authority to make an order simply means in the current context that the court has no authority to grant leave to cross-examine a witness unless satisfied of the matters set out in clause 13(5)(a) and (b), namely, identification of an issue; relevance of a witness’ evidence to that issue and justification of cross-examination of that witness on that issue. An incorrect decision by the Magistrates’ Court on those matters does not necessarily mean that there has been a jurisdictional error. Like Batt JA, I respectfully rely on what was said by the High Court of Australia in <em>Craig v South Australia</em>[8] in the passage quoted by His Honour. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;I therefore consider that it is not enough for Mr Gillespie-Jones to submit that the learned magistrate erred in deciding that, “the issues with respect to the cash” or “the provenance of the items found” were not matters relevant to these prosecutions. What has to be shown is that there was a constructive refusal to exercise jurisdiction. As Howie J put it in <em>McKirdy v McCosker</em>[9]:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;“The question for this Court is not whether the Magistrate was wrong in refusing to give the directions sought, even if this error involved a misconstruction of the section, but whether he failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon him by the section or so misconceived the nature and extent of the jurisdiction or the manner in which it was to be exercised that his purported exercise of the jurisdiction was in truth no exercise at all ...”<br /><strong>24.&nbsp;</strong>Having said all of that, I am not disposed to embark on a final determination of that question, and, for the following reasons, I decline to do so. As I have said, Mr Henderson’s notice seeking leave to cross-examine was not well drafted. Indeed, as Mrs Weinberg of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the second defendant, submitted, it may be doubted whether the notice complied with the requirements of clause 13(5) of Schedule 5. Mr Henderson’s legal representatives implicitly recognised this when they served the Amended Notice to Cross-Examine. It seems to me that that step having been taken, it would have been far better to have sought a further committal mention to allow Mr Henderson to make an application for leave to cross-examine based on the Amended Notice. I do not agree with Mr Gillespie-Jones’ explanation of why that was not done. I see no reason why the fact that the informant had indicated that he would still oppose leave being granted in respect of the issue of the missing money, meant that a further application could not have been made based on the Amended Notice. While the Magistrates’ Court may have regard to the informant’s attitude to the application in determining whether to grant the application, (clause 13(4) of Schedule 5), it goes without saying that it would be a constructive refusal by a magistrate to refuse the application simply because the informant had opposed it.<br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In the circumstances, it seems to me to be preferable for Mr Henderson to make an application based on the Amended Notice than for me to decide what could be seen as a hypothetical question given the existence of the Amended Notice. It should be remembered that the question of what cross-examination is allowed at a committal proceeding is one for the Magistrates’ Court. The learned magistrate will be fully aware of all of the relevant considerations. This court can only intervene when there has been a jurisdictional error or an actual or constructive refusal to exercise jurisdiction at all. It is not sufficient that I might have reached different conclusions from those of the learned magistrate on some or all of the issues. I do not consider that what can sometimes be a fine line between an error going to jurisdiction and one not doing so, should be determined in the context of this poorly drafted notice.<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Before concluding these reasons, I offer the following observations. The advantage of a fresh application based on the amended notice is that an attempt has been made in respect of each individual witness to identify the issue or issues to which the proposed questioning relates and to provide a reason why the evidence of that witness is relevant to that issue. No doubt further argument could be addressed by way of submission to the court in support of the proposition that cross-examination of that particular witness on that particular issue is justified. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;Obviously the reasons for granting or refusing leave to cross-examine will differ. In some cases, it may be that it is decided that an issue is not relevant or that the matters set out in clause 13(5A) do not require it to be investigated by cross-examination. In other cases, it may be decided that although the identified issue is relevant, the particular witness’ evidence in respect of that issue is not. Thus, leave may be given to cross-examine a particular witness in respect of one of more issues, but refused in respect of other issue or issues. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;During the course of argument I was assured by Mrs Weinberg that the Office of Public Prosecutions would not raise any objections to a fresh application being made by Mr Henderson at the commencement of the committal proceeding next Monday. There is power in the Magistrates’ Court to hear such an application despite a failure to comply with the time limits (clause 12(5) of Schedule 5). I was told that there would be no problem with the availability of witnesses. As I have said 11 of the 18, or perhaps now 19, police officers are already giving evidence, and it was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty in making the others available for cross-examination if required. <br /><strong>29.&nbsp;</strong>Therefore, for all of the above reasons, in the exercise of my discretion, I have decided to refuse the application on behalf of Mr Henderson for an order in the nature of mandamus. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See <em>Brygel v Stewart-Thornton </em>[1992] 2 VR 387 per JD Phillips J; <em>Potter v Tural </em>(2000) 2 VR 612 at [26] per Batt JA, with whom Tadgell JA agreed; and at [6] per Callaway JA. <br />[2] (1933) 50 CLR 228 at 242-243 <br />[3] (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416 at 420 <br />[4] per Batt JA at [26] <br />[5] (2004) NSWSC 74 at [27] per Shaw J <br />[6] See <em>Potter v Tural </em>per Batt JA at [26] and [51]. <br />[7] at [45] <br />[8] (1995) 184 CLR 163 <br />[9] (2002) NSWSC 197 at [4].</p>\r\n<p><strong>APPEARANCES:</strong> For the Plaintiff Henderson: Mr S Gillespie-Jones, counsel.

Upon appeal—<br /><br /><strong>HELD: Appeal dismissed.<br />1.&nbsp;<em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>[1979] VR 315 establishes that a pocket knife of the kind in question in this case is not to be regarded as an "offensive weapon" for the purposes of s77 of the Act unless the person who has it intends to use it for the purposes of attack or combat, as distinct from self-defence.<br />2.&nbsp;In a case like the present involving a pocket knife or other household knife, there is substantial room for overlap between facts which would bear on the question of intention in relation to the definition of "offensive weapon" and facts which would bear on the question of purpose in relation to the suggested implied element of s77(1)(a). Indeed, the relevant time in both respects seems to be the time of the burglary. The magistrate was not in error in finding that he was not satisfied that W.s general intention in carrying the knife went beyond self-defence or that W. had a specific intention to use the knife in the event that W. encountered someone in the course of the burglary.<br /><br />CAVANOUGH J:<br />Introduction <br />1.</strong>&nbsp;Shortly before 9.00 am on 7 April 2005 the respondent, Mr Woodward, drove to Barrington Street, Kew in a car he had stolen about a week earlier. Intent on further theft, he entered a house in that street by kicking in a window. He had with him a pocket knife and a screwdriver. Both were contained within his shorts. He did not encounter anyone in the house. He found and took away a laptop computer and within the hour he had sold it for money. He was arrested by police that same morning and interviewed at some length. He told the police that he always carried the pocket knife with him, not only when he was committing a burglary. He said that he carried it "just in case something happens ... someone attacked me or assaulted me or something like that". He denied emphatically that he would produce the knife if confronted by a person in a house he was burgling. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Woodward was charged with a series of offences. The charges were later amended and supplemented. Ultimately, on 25 August 2005, Mr Woodward faced eight charges at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court. They included burglary, theft and possessing a controlled weapon (the pocket knife) and going equipped to steal. In addition he was charged with aggravated burglary, contrary to s77(1) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 ("Crimes Act"). The circumstance of aggravation was alleged to be that he had a weapon with him, namely the pocket knife. He pleaded guilty to the other seven charges but not guilty to aggravated burglary.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the answers given by Mr Woodward to the police about the pocket knife were not truthful. Taking that into account, the Magistrate was not satisfied that the charge of aggravated burglary had been made out and dismissed it. He sentenced the respondent on the other charges. The informant is dissatisfied with the dismissal of the aggravated burglary charge. <br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Under s92 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 an appeal "on a question of law" may be brought to this Court from a decision of the Magistrates’ Court in a criminal matter. Where the party dissatisfied with the decision is a member of the police force (as informant), any appeal can only be brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the informant: s92(2). In Mr Woodward’s case Detective Senior Constable Callegaro was the informant, and the Director of Public Prosecutions brings this appeal on his behalf against the decision of the Magistrate to dismiss the charge of aggravated burglary. <br /><strong>The notice of appeal <br />5.</strong>&nbsp;An appeal under s 92 lies only on a question of law. The procedure for such appeals is governed by Part 3 of Order 58 of the Supreme Court Rules: r58.06. An appeal is instituted by filing a notice of appeal in the Trial Division: r58.07. The notice ought to set out or state, among other things, the question or questions of law upon which the appeal is brought and, concisely, the grounds of appeal: r58.08(1)(b)(iii) and (iv). The question(s) of law should be stated with precision; and the grounds of appeal should be the grounds on which the appellant contends that the Court should answer the question(s) of law in the appellant’s favour: see Williams, <em>Supreme Court Practice</em>, para I 58.06.100 and cases there cited. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The notice of appeal in the present case does not meet these requirements. As the (one and only) question of law, it asks:<br />"Did the learned Magistrate err in dismissing the charge of Aggravated Burglary, pursuant to section 77 <em>Crimes Act </em>1958."<br />This does not identify a question of law with precision, or at all[1]. The (one and only) stated ground of appeal is also unsatisfactory. It reads:"The learned Magistrate erred in dismissing the charge of Aggravated Burglary, pursuant to section 77 <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 despite the undisputed evidence that at the time of the commission of the burglary the Respondent was in possession of an offensive weapon."<br />Apart from the difficulty that there is no properly stated question of law to which this "ground" could relate, it is misleading in that, as the appellant ultimately acknowledged at the hearing before me, it is not true that there was "undisputed evidence" before the Magistrate that at the relevant time the respondent was in possession of an "offensive weapon". Further, the stated ground does not disclose the point which, at the hearing, turned out to be the appellant’s real point, to which I will come. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;However, the respondent did not take issue with the form of the notice of appeal, and its inadequacies were not the subject of any discussion at the hearing. Both parties filed written outlines of submissions in advance of the hearing, and they spoke to them at the hearing without complaining of any lack of notice of the arguments to be met. No doubt the notice of appeal could have been amended by leave.[2] However, for reasons I will explain, I think that this appeal must be dismissed in any event, and so I will not stay to consider what precise form of amendment of the notice of appeal might have been appropriate. <br /><strong>Relevant provisions of the <em>Crimes Act </em>1958 <br />8.</strong>&nbsp;Section 77 of the <em>Crimes Act </em>provides:<br />"77. Aggravated burglary<br />(1) A person is guilty of aggravated burglary if he or she commits a burglary and—<br />(a) at the time has with him or her any firearm or imitation firearm, any offensive weapon or any explosive or imitation explosive; or<br />(b) at the time of entering the building or the part of the building a person was then present in the building or part of the building and he or she knew that a person was then so present or was reckless as to whether or not a person was then so present.<br />(1A) For the purposes of sub-section (1)—<br />‘explosive’ means any article manufactured for the purpose of producing a practical effect by explosion, or intended by the person having it with him or her for that purpose;<br />‘firearm’ has the same meaning as in the <em>Firearms Act </em>1996;<br />‘imitation explosive’ means any article which might reasonably be taken to be or to contain an explosive;<br />‘imitation firearm’ means anything which has the appearance of being a firearm, whether capable of being discharged or not;<br /><u>‘offensive weapon’ means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, or which the person having it with him or her intends or threatens to use for such a purpose.<br /></u>(2) A person guilty of aggravated burglary is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to level 2 imprisonment (25 years maximum)."<br />(Emphasis added)<br /><strong>9</strong>.&nbsp;The penalty applicable to aggravated burglary, namely level 2 imprisonment (25 years maximum), exceeds substantially that applicable to simple burglary, which is level 5 imprisonment (10 years maximum): see s76(3) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;The provisions of the Act that relate to burglary and aggravated burglary occur in the same Division and under the same heading ("Theft, robbery, burglary &amp;c.") as those that relate to robbery (s 75) and armed robbery (s75A). Section 75A provides:<br />"75A. Armed robbery<br />(1) A person is guilty of armed robbery if he commits any robbery and at the time has with him a firearm, imitation firearm, offensive weapon, explosive or imitation explosive within the meaning assigned to those terms for the purposes of section 77(1).<br />(2) A person guilty of armed robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to level 2 imprisonment (25 years maximum)."<br />It will be noted that s75A is similar in expression to s77 and that it contains an express cross-reference to s77(1). Further, the penalty for armed robbery (level 5 imprisonment) is the same as the penalty for aggravated burglary, and it exceeds that applicable to simple robbery (level 2 imprisonment) to the same extent as the penalty for aggravated burglary exceeds that for simple burglary.<br /><strong>The appellant’s contentions <br />11.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant submits that the learned Magistrate proceeded on the basis that it is an element of the offence under s77(1)(a) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>that the burglar not only have with him or her a firearm, imitation firearm, offensive weapon, explosive or imitation explosive at the time of the burglary, but also that he or she have it with him or her <u>for the purpose of the burglary</u>. According to the appellant, the latter is neither expressly nor impliedly included as an element of the offence under s77(1)(a). <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant further submits that in the present case the Magistrate dismissed the charge because he was not satisfied that this putative element had been made out on the evidence. In this regard he relies on certain observations made by the Magistrate in the course of his Honour’s oral reasons for decision (which were transcribed) and to which I will come. <br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant does not submit that, but for this alleged error, the Magistrate would necessarily have convicted the respondent. Rather, he says, the matter should go back to the Magistrate for him to make a finding on another issue which the appellant (now) admits did arise, namely whether the pocket knife was an "offensive weapon" within the meaning of that expression as defined in s77(1A).[3] The appellant says that the Magistrate went straight to the suggested "purpose" element without stopping to determine whether or not the pocket knife was an offensive weapon as defined. On the authority of <em>Wilson v Kuhl</em>[4] the appellant concedes that the pocket knife was not an "offensive weapon" <u>in itself</u>. In other words, he concedes that it was not an "article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person" within the first limb of the definition. However he says that on the evidence it would have been (and would still be) open to the Magistrate to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the pocket knife fell within the second limb, ie that it was an article "which the person having it with him or her intends or threatens to use for such a purpose". On the other hand, the appellant does not go so far as to submit that the evidence was (or would be) such as to <u>compel</u> a finding (beyond reasonable doubt) that the pocket knife was an offensive weapon. (These submissions may be contrasted with the assertion in the notice of appeal that there was "undisputed evidence" that the respondent was in possession of an "offensive weapon".) <br /><strong>The respondent’s contentions <br />14.</strong>&nbsp;The respondent denies that the Magistrate’s reasoning should be characterised in the way complained of by the appellant. The respondent says that the Magistrate did, at least in effect, make a finding on the issue whether the pocket knife was to be regarded as an "offensive weapon", to wit, that he was not so satisfied (beyond reasonable doubt). It was on this basis, according to the respondent, that the Magistrate dismissed the charge. Accordingly, he says, there is no need in this appeal to determine the question whether it is an additional element of the offence under s77(1)(a) that the accused have the relevant article with him or her for the purpose of the burglary, or the question whether the Magistrate proceeded on the basis that it was. The respondent says that the appellant is really seeking to attack the Magistrate’s finding of fact on the "offensive weapon" issue, which is not permissible in an appeal confined to a question of law.[5] The respondent did not argue, in the alternative or otherwise, that there is indeed in law an additional "purpose" element. <br /><strong>The appellant’s contentions in reply <br />15.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant concedes that if the Magistrate did in truth make a finding that he was not satisfied that the pocket knife was to be regarded as an offensive weapon, then the appeal must fail. Otherwise he joins issue with the respondent’s contentions. <br /><strong>Consideration <br />16.</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion, the respondent’s contentions are in substance correct and the appeal should be dismissed accordingly. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;The parties are divided as to the proper interpretation or understanding of the Magistrate’s reasons. However the appellant has not sought to overturn the Magistrate’s decision simply on the ground that his reasons are inadequate or ambiguous, and so the appellant must actually demonstrate error (of law) on the part of the Magistrate.[6] <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;Further, the appellant must show that the alleged error of law had a vitiating effect on the decision.[7] In other words, the appellant must at least show "that the decision may have been different if the error had not occurred".[8<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;In seeking to ascertain the true basis or the true reasons for a decision of a court, it may be proper to look beyond particular statements contained in the reasons. In <em>Intertransport International Private Ltd &amp; Anor v Donaldson &amp; Anor</em>[9], Chernov JA (with whom Eames JA agreed) said[10]:<br />"It may be that the basis for the decision can be inferred from the whole of the reasons for judgment, having regard to the circumstances of the case. As Gray J explained in [<em>Sun Alliance Insurance v Massoud </em>[1989] VR 8 at 19], <br />‘The simplicity of the context of the case or the state of the evidence may be such that a mere statement of the judge’s conclusion will sufficiently indicate the basis of a decision. ... In such cases, the foundation for the judge’s conclusion will be indicated as a matter of necessary inference’.<br />Whether a judgment sufficiently indicates the basis of the decision depends, as I have said, on the circumstances of the case, including how the case was conducted by the parties and, relevantly for present purposes, what were the principal issues in dispute between them."<br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;In the present case, the true import of what the Magistrate said and did not say in his oral reasons can best be understood by reference to the way in which the case was conducted before him and the main issues that were fought out. This in turn requires some understanding of the main authorities to which the parties referred. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;It was common ground that <em>Wilson v Kuhl</em>[11], although itself a case on the construction of the <em>Vagrancy Act </em>1966, establishes that a pocket knife of the kind in question here is not to be regarded as an "offensive weapon" for the purposes of s77 of the <em>Crimes Act </em>unless the person who has it intends to use it for the purposes of attack or combat, as distinct from self-defence.[12] This approach is supported by a passage in <em>R v Pope</em>[13] to which I will refer below. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams</em>, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal referred to ss75A and s77(1) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>and proceeded[14]:<br />"It has been decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in relation to a statute <em>in pari materia </em>that the words ‘has with him’ mean ‘knowingly has with him’: <em>R v Cugullere </em>[1961] 1 WLR 858. But this is not all that the words in their context connote. The essence of the crime of robbery is stealing with the use of force or the putting of any person in fear of being subjected to force. ‘Armed robbery’ has the additional element of ‘having with him’ one of the weapons described in s75A. The use of force or the putting of a person in fear is still a necessary element. It would seem to follow therefore that the possession of a weapon would at least have to be <u>for the purpose of the robbery</u>. If a person committed a robbery and had at the time an imitation pistol concealed in a sealed package in an inside pocket of his clothing and no use was made of it during the robbery it is not to be supposed that the legislature intended that he should be guilty of armed robbery. The use of the word ‘armed’ must colour the words ‘has with him’ and they show in our opinion that the possession of the weapon must be <u>for the purpose of the robbery</u>." <br />(Emphasis added.)<br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>R v Tommy Reid</em>[15], the Victorian Court of Appeal said[16]:<br />"It is established that armed robbery is committed even if the weapon is not visible, provided it is available to be used by the offender; <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams</em>, unreported, Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria, 14 December 1979; per Young CJ, McInerney and Gobbo JJ; pp.12-13. It might have been otherwise if the applicant had been for some reason unable to make any use of the weapon at the time of the offence, or if his possession of the weapon had been <u>for some other purpose</u>." <br />(Emphasis added.)<br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>R v Nguyen</em>[17] the accused, in the course of stealing drugs from a pharmacy, threatened and tried to hit staff with a half-full plastic soft drink bottle. He was convicted of armed robbery and appealed, raising the question whether the plastic bottle was capable of being an offensive weapon. His appeal failed. The Court held that the offence is committed if a person commits a robbery and has with him at the time an article which that person then intends or threatens to use for the purpose of causing injury to or threatening another person. <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;In <em>R v Pope</em>[18], Callaway JA (with whom Phillips CJ and Batt JA agreed) said[19] that there was an "obvious affinity" between, on the one hand, the provisions of s77(1)(a) and the definition of "offensive weapon" in s77(1A) and, on the other hand, the provisions of s75A relating to armed robbery that were discussed in <em>R v Nguyen</em>, <em>supra</em>. His Honour proceeded (referring to a knife relevantly indistinguishable from the pocket knife involved in the present case):<br />"It was common ground that a knife of that kind is not an offensive weapon in itself (compare <em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>[1979] VR 315 at 320-322), so that there had to be an intention of the kind referred to in the second part of the definition of ‘offensive weapon’ and that intention had to exist at the time of entry. That would appear to follow from the definition and the words ‘at the time’ in s77(1)(a)."<br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;Finally, in <em>R v Stones</em>[20], the English Court of Appeal considered the offence of aggravated burglary created by a statutory provision not relevantly distinguishable from s77(1) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>. The facts were very similar to those of the present case. The accused had been apprehended by police immediately after burgling a house. When searched, he was found to have a household knife in his pocket. When asked why he had it with him, he replied: "For self-defence, because some lads from Blyth are after me". It was held that if the accused knowingly had the knife with him at the time of the burglary with the intention of using it to cause injury to or incapacitate the lads from Blyth if he met them, the offence was proved. It was not necessary to prove the intention to use the knife to cause injury etc during the course of the burglary. The mischief at which the section was aimed was that if a burglar has a weapon which he intends to use to injure some person unconnected with the premises burgled, he may nevertheless be tempted to use it if challenged during the course of the burglary and put under sufficient pressure.[21] <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;It can be seen from the Victorian authorities, and from the terms of the relevant statutory provisions, that there would have been scope for the accused to argue, or for the Magistrate to form the view, that it was an implied element of the offence under s77(1)(a) that the accused have the relevant article with him or her <u>for the purpose of the burglary</u>. After all, on the face of it, there seems to be little reason to distinguish between s77(1) and s75A in that respect. However there are arguments to the contrary, and the appellant put them to the Magistrate and to me. He relied in particular on the presence of the words "armed with" in s75A and their absence in s77(1)(a). He also argued that <em>R v Stones </em>was indistinguishable and should be followed. He denied that <em>R v Stones </em>was in conflict with <em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>and with the passage from R v Pope cited above. He said that "carrying" offences were to be distinguished from "use" offences.[22] As indicated above, and for reasons which I will further develop below, I consider that I have no need to decide this issue. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant also argued that in <em>R v Pope </em>the only basis to conclude that Mr Pope’s pocket knife was an offensive weapon was his intention at the time of entry into the premises, as inferred from his actions immediately after entry. By contrast, the appellant said, in the present case there is ample evidence on which the Court could conclude that the pocket knife was "generally" an offensive weapon as discussed by McGarvie J in <em>Wilson v Kuhl</em>[23]. The evidence included the respondent’s interview with the police, his carrying of the weapon to and from the premises, the concealment of the knife down the front of his pants (as distinct from his pocket) and the nature of the knife itself. Once again, I need not decide whether a pocket knife or household knife can ever be deemed to be "generally" an offensive weapon in the hands of a particular person. <em>R v Pope</em>, <em>supra</em>, seems to suggest the contrary, ie that in each case one must assess the situation as at the relevant time. In any event, all of the evidence was considered by the learned Magistrate and it did not lead him to find that the accused was "generally", or on the relevant particular occasion, in possession of an "offensive weapon". Absent some vitiating error of law I could not gainsay the Magistrate in this regard. <br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;In a case like the present involving a pocket knife or other household knife, there is substantial room for overlap between facts which would bear on the question of intention in relation to the definition of "offensive weapon" and facts which would bear on the question of purpose in relation to the suggested implied element of s77(1)(a). Indeed, as just mentioned, the relevant time in both respects seems to be the time of the burglary. With these considerations in mind I turn to the actual course of the proceedings before the Magistrate.<br /><strong>The proceedings before the Magistrate <br />30.</strong>&nbsp;The only evidence before the Magistrate was the evidence contained in the hand-up brief. It was admitted by consent. No oral evidence was adduced. By prior agreement, the matter proceeded by way of a plea on the seven admitted charges and by way of a contest, in the form of oral argument by counsel, on the remaining charge of aggravated burglary. The same counsel appeared before the Magistrate as later appeared before me. <br /><strong>31.</strong>&nbsp;The hand-up brief included a transcript of an interview between the police and the respondent conducted on the day of the burglary in question (7 April 2005), after the respondent’s apprehension. The critical questions and answers were as follows:<br />"Q 154 Okay. Do you agree that you had a – a knife? <br />A Yeah, yeah. <br />Q 155 Whereabouts was that? <br />A At the front of me pants. <br />Q 156 Yeah. So, how long’d that been there? <br />It’s always there. <br />Q 157 It’s always there? <br />A Yeah. <br />Q 158 Okay. So, was the knife down the – well, why do you carry a knife down the front of your pants? <br />A Just in case something happens. <br />Q 159 Well, w-, what’d you mean ‘something’? What’d you mean by ‘something’? <br />A Someone – something – someone attacks me, or something like that. <br />Q 160 Okay. <br />A Protect meself, s’pose. <br />Q 161 Okay. So, you obviously don’t sleep with it down your pants, do you? <br />A No. <br />Q 162 So, where was it this morning when you woke up? <br />A Pardon? <br />Q 163 Where was it this morning when you woke up? <br />A On the bench. <br />Q 164 Okay. Di-, and – so you slept at 17 Palmer Street, this morning? <br />A Yeah. <br />Q 165 What time did you go out? <br />A I’m not sure. <br />Q 166 Roughly? <br />A About ei-, 8.30. <br />Q 167 Okay. <br />A Quarter to 9.00. <br />Q 168 And was – so, did you put your knife – the knife down your pants at that point? <br />A Uh huh. <br />Q 169 Sorry? <br />A Yep. <br />Q 170 Okay. A-, and did it come out of your pants at any time between when you put it in this morning and when you were arrested? <br />A Nah. <br />Q 171 Mm. So, was the knife down the front of your pants when you committed the burglary? <br />A Yeah. <br />... <br />Q 200 Just going back to the – the knife that you carry down your – your pants. Is there any particular reason why you – you carry a knife when you’re committing a burglary? <br />A It’s not just when I’m committing a burglary, it’s at all times. Always carry a knife with me just in case something happens. <br />Q 201 Okay. <br />A ... someone attacked me or assaults me or something like that. <br />Q 202 Well, we’ll just take it one step further, as far as that reasoning goes. If you were to commit a burglary and you’re confronted by a person in the house. Would that be an occasion - - - ? <br />A Nah. <br />Q 203 When you might produce a knife? <br />A Nah, nah, nah, nah. <br />Q 204 Sorry? <br />A No. <br />Q 205 Can you say that for certain? <br />A Yeah. Yeah."<br /><strong>32.</strong>&nbsp;Before the Magistrate, Mr Regan, as counsel for Mr Woodward, repeatedly submitted that in the light of Mr Woodward’s "intention" as revealed by these questions and answers the Magistrate should not find that the pocket knife was, at the relevant time, an offensive weapon within the meaning of s77(1A) of the <em>Crimes Act</em>.[24] In making these submissions, Mr Regan principally relied on <em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>and <em>R v Pope </em>rather than <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams </em>and <em>R v Tommy Reid</em>. <br /><strong>33.</strong>&nbsp;Initially, the Magistrate appeared to think that Mr Regan was or should be relying on the approach taken in <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams </em>and <em>R v Tommy Reid</em>. However he soon appreciated that there was also a dispute as to whether the pocket knife was to be regarded as an "offensive weapon" at all. This is clear not only from the Magistrate’s responses[25] to the submissions referred to in the previous paragraph, but also from certain exchanges between the Magistrate and counsel for the informant, Mr Hughan. For example, at one point[26] the Magistrate interrupted Mr Regan and turned to Mr Hughan and discussed with him whether the knife was an "offensive weapon" within the definition. Mr Hughan effectively conceded, on the authority of <em>Wilson v Kuhl</em>, that the pocket knife should not be regarded as an offensive weapon "per se", ie within the first limb of the definition, and that it would be necessary to consider the second limb of the definition and the question of Mr Woodward’s "intention". <br /><strong>34.</strong>&nbsp;Some of the debate between the Magistrate and counsel related specifically to the holding in <em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>that a person found armed with a carving knife intended to be used only in self-defence is not found armed with an offensive weapon.[27] Mr Hughan submitted that the concept of self-defence for this purpose should be restricted to its legal sense as expounded in <em>Zecevic v DPP</em>[28]. The Magistrate seemed unconvinced by this.[29] <br /><strong>35.</strong>&nbsp;At a relatively early stage, the Magistrate was fully alive to the fact that Mr Regan was putting his submission as a separate and preliminary point. For example, he said early on to Mr Regan[30]:<br />"So what, your preliminary point is that under <em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>unless I’m satisfied that he carries the knife for an aggressive – intentionally for an aggressive purpose and not for any sort of – if as he says in his record of interview he carries it for self defence it’s not an offensive weapon and the argument is lost there?"<br />Mr Regan replied: "That’s right". On the other hand, the Magistrate twice[31] thereafter indicated that he thought that the question whether the knife was an offensive weapon, and the cases relating to that question, were largely "academic", because the real issue was whether the Crown could satisfy him beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the knife on him specifically for the purpose of the burglary. However, a little later, after some school children had apparently come into the Court to observe proceedings, the Magistrate addressed them and said, among other things:<br />"So the argument now is whether the burglary is aggravated by him allegedly being in possession of the knife. That involves questions of whether it’s an offensive weapon. That involves questions of what purpose the Crown can satisfy me that the man had the knife and all of those sorts of matters."[32]<br />Later again, the Magistrate put to Mr Hughan, and Mr Hughan effectively conceded, that if the pocket knife was not an offensive weapon the prosecution must fail.[33]<br /><strong>36.</strong>&nbsp;It is true that the Magistrate repeatedly expressed the view that <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams </em>and <em>R v Tommy Reid </em>were important cases.[34] Mr Regan himself did refer in some detail[35] to <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams </em>and <em>R v Tommy Reid </em>and, perhaps encouraged by the Magistrate’s enthusiasm for those cases, he sought in a sense to rely on them, but principally he said that they were distinguishable.[36] The very last submission he made was that "the Crown can’t get up beyond reasonable doubt on the offensive weapon".[37]<strong><br />37.</strong>&nbsp;After this extensive debate the Magistrate adjourned for a short time to consider his decision. It seems very unlikely that during that period he would have forgotten or overlooked that Mr Regan’s main submission was that the informant had not proved that the accused’s intention at the time of the burglary was to use the knife, or to threaten to use it, to cause injury to or incapacitate a person, and that therefore the informant had not proved that the accused had with him at the time of the burglary an "offensive weapon" as defined. In my view this background casts significant light on the meaning and import of the observations made by the Magistrate in the course of giving his reasons, to which I now turn. <br /><strong>The Magistrate’s reasons for decision <br />38.</strong>&nbsp;The learned Magistrate began his reasons by referring briefly to certain common ground as to what the accused had done on the day in question. He then referred to the relevant part of s 77(1)(a) of the <em>Crimes Act </em>and, significantly, he went on to recite in full the definition of "offensive weapon" in s77(1A). His Honour then said:<br />"It’s conceded by the prosecution that the knife in this case does not meet the words, ‘Any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person’ and so if it’s an offensive weapon or if offensive weapon is relevant here, it can only be constituted by the second part of that definition being an article which the person having it with him intends or threatens to use for such a purpose."[38]<br />Next his Honour said that he would not go into the detail of all of the cases to which he had been referred but would state his conclusions. He continued:<br />"In my view to establish this charge against the defendant the prosecution must satisfy me of the following: firstly, that the defendant at the time he entered into the residential premises did so with an intention to steal and secondly, that at the time he entered he was in possession of an offensive weapon in the sense that he had on his person an article which he either intended to use or intended to threaten to use to cause injury or to incapacitate a person inside the house if he was disturbed during the burglary."[39]<br />His Honour then referred to <em>R v Pope </em>at some length and went on:<br />"I find this judgment helpful in resolving issues dealt with in argument in the following ways: (1) in my view the comment about ‘obvious affinity’ between s75A and s77(1) clearly supports my suggestion in argument to Mr Hughan that there did not appear to me to be a legitimate basis for suggesting that the cases of [<em>R v Kolb and Adams</em>], Court of Criminal Appeal of Victoria 14/12/1979 and <em>R v Tommy Reid</em>, Court of Criminal Appeal 7/4/1998 dealing with armed robbery and clearly requiring that for that offence at least the requirement that the possession of the weapon be for a purpose connected with the offence should not be applied to the offence of aggravated burglary but that the approach of the Court of Appeal in England [as] shown in <em>R v Stones </em>(1989) 1 WLR 156 should be adopted. In my view Pope’s case is inconsistent with Stones on this point and I would of course follow <em>Pope’s </em>case. In my view, [Mr Justice Callaway’s] talking about the obvious affinity. In my view, it’s clear authority that the argument relied on by Mr Hughan on the basis of Stones’ case is not the law here in Victoria at least. In my view the prosecution must prove that at the time of entry the defendant was in possession of an offensive weapon and that he had the weapon for a purpose connected with the burglary as talked about albeit for armed robbery [in <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams</em>] and <em>Tommy Reid</em>. <br />Even allowing for this, in argument a number of additional matters were raised. It seemed common ground that on the issue of offensive weapon the cases of <em>Wilson v Kuhl</em>, <em>Ryan v Kuhl</em>, (1979) VR 315 were pertinent but issues remain. What is the relevant time to look at the question of being in possession of an offensive weapon? The evidence might seek to establish that the defendant carries a knife for an aggressive purpose when going about his interactions in society and as such the defendant could be said to have been armed with an offensive weapon according to the principles of <em>Wilson v Kuhl </em>when he attended at the house. But what was required to prove that he also was in possession of the knife for a purpose connected with the burglary? Would it be enough to establish that although there was a doubt about whether he would use it to injure or threaten injury if disturbed during the course of the burglary, it was open to be satisfied that he took it to jemmy a window if he needed to or to cut something once inside the house. <br />What I mean by that is it seemed in argument that arguably what was being suggested or what the law might allow for is that a person, if you put the burglary to one side, if a person could otherwise be said to be in possession of an offensive weapon outside the house, that that somehow could transfer and form part of the – you would commit an aggravated burglary if you then used, in connection with the burglary, that offensive weapon, albeit not in a way to threaten or injure someone. But again in my view Pope’s case makes it clear what is required. The question of the defendant’s intention in possessing the knife is not in the air so to speak as to time. <strong>What is required given the particular knife in this case on this issue is proof beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of entry into the premises with an intent to steal the defendant ‘had with him an offensive weapon’ in the sense that he was in possession of an article which he either intended to use or intended to threaten to use to cause injury to a person inside the house if he was disturbed during the burglary. <br /></strong>I think <em>Pope’s </em>case just makes this as clear as it can possibly be. I don’t think the law is at all unclear in this matter. I think it is very much as I thought really at the time a matter of – I take that back. <strong>It’s probably been clarified that it really is a question of looking at the ingredients of what might make an offensive weapon but I think <em>Pope’s </em>case, Callaway J’s decision is very, very clear. So am I satisfied that at the time he entered with an intent to steal he was in possession of an article which he either intended to use or intended to threaten to use to cause injury to a person inside the house if he was disturbed during the burglary."[40] </strong>(Emphasis added)<br /><strong>39.</strong>&nbsp;His Honour then closely and carefully examined Mr Woodward’s record of interview. He stressed Mr Woodward’s vehement denial that the knife would have been produced if he had encountered someone in the house. His Honour said[41] that he was "certainly" not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the answers given by the accused were not truthful. I would infer from this that his Honour was not satisfied that Mr Woodward’s <u>general </u>intention in carrying the knife went beyond self-defence, and it is clearer still that his Honour was not satisfied that Mr Woodward had a <u>specific</u> intention to use the knife in the event that he encountered someone in the course of the burglary. His Honour concluded:<br />"Ultimately I’m not satisfied that the defendant had possession of the knife at the time of the burglary with the requisite intention to use it either to – if the occasion arose to threaten a householder. I am not satisfied that on the evidence this is an aggravated burglary and the charge is dismissed."[42]<br /><strong>40.</strong>&nbsp;I acknowledge that at no stage during the giving of his reasons did the Magistrate explicitly and distinctly state a finding that he was not satisfied that the pocket knife was to be regarded as an "offensive weapon" within the meaning of section 77(1A). However I think that the Magistrate did ask himself the corresponding question, and that in effect he answered it, adversely to the appellant, without committing any vitiating legal error. <br /><strong>41.</strong>&nbsp;The best indication that the relevant question was asked is provided by the two passages towards the end of his Honour’s reasons which are emphasised above. In those passages the word "intention" is used and the word "purpose" is not. The language closely reflects the definition of "offensive weapon" in s77(1A). <br /><strong>42.</strong>&nbsp;That the Magistrate went on to <u>answer</u> that very question, and that he answered it adversely to the appellant, is indicated strongly by the language of the last two sentences of his Honour’s reasons, set out above. <br /><strong>43.</strong>&nbsp;The appellant however points out that the Magistrate had also said, previously, that the prosecution had to prove "purpose" as mentioned in <em>R v Kolb &amp; Adams </em>and <em>R v Tommy Reid</em>. The appellant further points out that in each of the three passages just mentioned the Magistrate refers to what the accused might have done had he been "disturbed during the burglary" or "if the occasion arose to threaten a householder". The appellant submits that these references indicate that the Magistrate was really asking himself, <u>only</u>, whether the accused had the pocket knife with him "for the purpose of the burglary", rather than the question posed by the definition of "offensive weapon". <br /><strong>44.</strong>&nbsp;I disagree. It may be that the Magistrate asked himself the "purpose" question, but even if he did, he also asked himself the "intention" question, in my opinion. Once the Magistrate held, as he did, that <em>R v Stones </em>was not good law in Victoria[43], and once he held, as he did, that it was necessary to consider the accused’s intention not "in the air" <u>but as at the time of entry into the premises</u>[44], it was inevitable and proper that the Magistrate’s attention should be focused on what the accused might do if disturbed during the burglary or if he came upon the householder. No-one other than a person whom the accused might encounter in the course of burgling the premises was of any relevance or significance for the purpose of assessing whether, <u>at the time of entering the premises</u>, the accused intended to use or to threaten to use the pocket knife to cause injury or to incapacitate. <br /><strong>45.&nbsp;</strong>As mentioned above, the appellant bore the onus of persuading me that the Magistrate erred in law in the manner alleged. I am not so persuaded. Indeed I am satisfied that, in the end, the Magistrate correctly understood and applied the definition of "offensive weapon" in s77(1A). It was common ground that the prosecution had to prove, at least, that this definition was met, whereas there was a dispute about the existence of the other suggested requirement. It would be very odd for a Magistrate in that situation to make no finding on an issue that admittedly arose (and was critical), whether or not the Magistrate also chose to venture a ruling on the other matter. As indicated above, I accept that the Magistrate may have concluded that both issues arose and that he may have actually decided both. But I am satisfied that he did at least decide the "preliminary" issue (as to whether or not there was an "offensive weapon"). <br /><strong>46.</strong>&nbsp;Even if I am wrong in that regard, and even if I assume further –<br />• that the Magistrate dismissed the charge <u>only</u> because he was not satisfied that the accused had the pocket knife with him "for the purpose of the burglary"; and <br />• that as a matter of law there is no implied "purpose" element in the general words of s 77(1)(a),<br />nevertheless I would not be satisfied that the Magistrate’s assumed error vitiated his decision. I would not be satisfied that the decision might have been different if the assumed error had not occurred. In the present case, given the Magistrate’s actual decision, the hypothesis involves the proposition that the Magistrate asked <u>and answered</u> the wrong question. But, if so, he answered it adversely to the appellant. In other words the hypothesis involves the proposition that the Magistrate was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the pocket knife with him for the purpose of the burglary. This would mean that the Magistrate was not satisfied (beyond reasonable doubt) that the accused was in possession of the pocket knife for <u>any</u> purpose connected with the burglary. On this hypothesis it would follow, in my opinion, that the Magistrate could not properly have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use or to threaten to use the pocket knife for causing injury to or incapacitating a householder or anyone else <u>at the relevant time</u>. Further and in any event, as indicated in paragraph 39 above, I would infer that the Magistrate was not satisfied that the accused <u>ever</u> had the pocket-knife for "offensive" purposes as distinct from "self-defence" purposes. For these reasons the Magistrate would have been required to answer the "correct" question adversely to the appellant, and therefore would have been required to dismiss the charge in any event. <br /><strong>47.</strong>&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, I reiterate that nothing I have said above should be taken as expressing a view on the pure question of law whether there is an implied "purpose" element in the general words of s 77(1)(a).[45] The consideration and determination of that issue should await a case in which it truly arises.[46] <br /><strong>Conclusion <br />48.</strong>&nbsp;For these reasons I would dismiss this appeal. Subject to any submissions to the contrary, I would order the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] See <em>Comcare v Etheridge </em>[2006] FCAFC 27 at [11]-[31] and cases there cited. <br />[2] See r 58.08(3); compare Order 58 rule 13 of the <em>Supreme Court Rules</em> 1996 and <em>Barneveld v Hume City Council </em>[2004] VSC 350 (Redlich J) at [72]-[76]. <br />[3] Transcript of argument, page 12 lines 3-5. <br />[4] [1979] VR 315.

The evidence had travelled beyond the stage of production of the Debt Sale Agreement and the computer printout and extended to all of the evidence including that pertaining to sending the notice of the assignment to the appellant. The notice was signed by the bank and CCS and identified as having assigned any debt owed by Q. to the bank. Standing back and considering the evidence overall, and noting the absence of Annexure A, there was yet sufficient, directly and inferentially, to found the conclusion on the balance of probabilities at which the Magistrate arrived. <br /><br />HANSEN J:<br />1.</strong>&nbsp;This is an appeal under s109 of the <em>Magistrates’ Court Act </em>1989 from orders made by the Magistrates’ Court at Melbourne on 21 October 2005 whereby the appellant/defendant was ordered to pay the respondent/plaintiff the amount claimed of $10,728.94, interest in the sum of $1,801.80 and costs to be assessed in default of agreement. <br /><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;As stated in particulars to the Complaint the appellant was sued on the following basis:<br />(a) On 3 August 1999 Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd ("Westpac") approved the appellant’s application for credit by the issue of a Visa card. By his defence the appellant said that he admitted the allegations although he could not recall the date of the approval. <br />(b) On 8 July 2004 Westpac assigned the debt to the respondent notice whereof was forwarded to the appellant on 4 March 2004. The defence denied these allegations, specifically denying receipt of notice of the assignment, and that the assignment was valid at law. <br />(c) The amount claimed was owed as the balance due pursuant to the Visa card following default on 15 November 2002, and including interest at 16.95 percent per annum. The appellant denied being indebted to the respondent. In particulars to that denial it was said, in summary:<br />(i) the alleged debt was extinguished by an agreement made by his solicitors with Westpac in September 2002 by which Westpac agreed to take a lesser sum in satisfaction of the amount allegedly owing, and pursuant to which the agreed sum was sent to Westpac. <br />(ii) the alleged assignment was invalid as it constituted a breach of the terms of the appellant’s agreement with Westpac which included Westpac’s privacy code which forbad disclosure of the appellant’s personal information to the respondent.<br /><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The case was heard on 25 July 2005. I have been provided with a transcript of the hearing. The respondent called one witness, Leslie Joanne Cass, a senior legal clerk in the employ of the respondent. In the course of her evidence three documents were produced, a Debt Sale Agreement between Westpac and the respondent dated 8 July 2003, a proforma Notice of Assignment of Debt addressed to the appellant, signed on behalf of Westpac and the respondent and dated 23 June 2005, and a computer printout of debts concerned with the Debt Sale Agreement including the amount owed by the appellant at the time of the assignment. The first two documents were marked as Exhibits 1 and 2 respectively. The third document was not so marked but it was received and taken into account by the Magistrate and is to be treated as an exhibit in the case.<br /><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Following completion of the evidence of Ms Cass counsel for the respondent closed his case. Counsel for the appellant elected to call no evidence, and submitted that for several reasons the respondent had not established its case. The first reason was that the Debt Sale Agreement, which constituted the assignment, contained no reference to the appellant. The Agreement referred to the debts assigned as being those specified in Annexure A, but the Agreement produced in evidence did not include that annexure. Nor had it been discovered and no evidence had been given as to its whereabouts. Hence the respondent had failed to establish an assignment to it of any debt owed by the appellant to Westpac. Further, the computer printout was not part of the Agreement. <br /><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the appellant then went to another point which relied on the Victorian Consumer Credit legislation. It is not necessary to explain the contention as no point concerning it is raised on the appeal. <br /><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;After hearing counsel for the respondent the Magistrate directed the provision of sequential written submissions, gave liberty to apply to list the matter for further mention and reserved the costs of the proceeding. In doing so the Magistrate said that the appellant "no longer or can rely upon accord and satisfaction, nor the <em>Privacy Act </em>nor upon the sending of the notice of assignment". He had earlier observed that "the <em>Privacy Act </em>provisions are not going to be relied upon nor is the failure to send notice of assignment". It is convenient to add that before me counsel for the appellant said that the existence of the credit card facility with Westpac, and the amount of the debt, were not in issue before the Magistrate. <br /><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Pursuant to the directions the parties provided written submissions. <br /><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;On 21 October 2005 the Magistrate published reasons for judgment and made the orders referred to above. In his reasons, shortly stated, he concluded that the respondent had established the assignment of the appellant’s debt and that the respondent sent notice of the assignment to the appellant. He then went on to deal with other grounds of defence as to which it is unnecessary to make reference as no question concerning them arises on this appeal. It is sufficient to note that he concluded in favour of the respondent. <br /><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;The notice of appeal filed by the appellant sought the setting aside of the orders on a number of grounds. In an outline of argument filed on 26 July 2006, the day before the scheduled hearing of the appeal, the appellant limited his appeal to ground one in the notice of appeal. That ground concerned the finding of the Magistrate that the respondent had established the assignment of the appellant’s debt, which finding was attacked on the basis that the original assignment including the annexure, or a copy thereof, had not been produced and evidence had not been given, whether under s53B of the <em>Evidence Act </em>1958 or otherwise, which established the assignment. <br /><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;In light of the abandonment of all but ground one it is not necessary to refer to the other grounds set out in the notice of appeal. It should be noted however that in presenting his argument counsel for the appellant relied on an additional ground, which might be comprehended by ground three, that it was not open to the Magistrate to find that notice of the assignment had been sent to the appellant. I heard the argument on the point but, having done so and considered the evidence, the point must fail for the simple reason that the finding was open on the evidence. It is important in this respect to bear in mind the approach that is taken to a finding of fact on an appeal from the Magistrates’ Court on a question of law. On such an appeal the question is whether there was any evidence upon which the Magistrate could have made the finding or decision in question[1]. In my view there was such evidence, to which I make further reference below in the course of discussing the evidence. <br /><strong>11.</strong>&nbsp;That leaves for consideration the sole ground that the respondent had not established the assignment of the appellant’s debt to the respondent. More specifically, it was submitted that there was no evidence on which the Magistrate could have been satisfied on the balance of probabilities of the alleged assignment. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent submitted that there was uncontradicted evidence of the assignment of the appellant’s debt. <br /><strong>12.</strong>&nbsp;These submissions require reference to the evidence.<br /><strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;Ms Cass first explained that the respondent operated as a debt collector and credit provider and purchased debts from banks including Westpac and other financial institutions. She had been employed by the respondent for three months. Employees "there when all this happened" had left. She obtained her information from the normal business records. She said that the respondent purchased some book debts from Westpac on 8 July 2003 and produced the Debt Sale Agreement. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the document was incomplete as the annexure was not included, to which counsel for the respondent said that that was all he had in respect of that document. Ms Cass then agreed with counsel for the respondent that she had made "inquiries in respect of these matters and this matter specifically" and produced "a computer printout of a number of debts that are concerned [with] this particular agreement including the defendant". The list showed the amount of $10,426.26 as outstanding at the time of the deed of assignment. On the printout then being tendered counsel for the appellant sought clarification as to the basis of the tender as the Agreement tendered referred to Annexure A but not to some other computer printout. He also called for production of Annexure A. Ms Cass said that she did not have "the complete full schedule". <br /><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;The evidence in chief continued with Ms Cass explaining how matters were handled by reference to the respondent’s file which she had. She referred to an Entry List on the file and to communications with the appellant commencing on 8 March 2004 in which the appellant referred to a final deed with Westpac and having paid the account. In the course of this evidence counsel for the appellant stated that there was a settlement. Then, Ms Cass referred to notice of the assignment having been sent to the appellant at several addresses and on different dates. The respondent did not keep a copy of each notice of assignment sent to debtors. She produced a proforma of the notices of assignment, which became Exhibit 2, which, in its terms, stated that on 8 July 2003 Westpac assigned to the respondent its interest in any amount owing or to become owing by the appellant to Westpac in connection with his account, and stating that any further communication should be sent to the respondent. <br /><strong>15.</strong>&nbsp;Ms Cass was cross-examined in the course of which she said that a notice of assignment was sent to the appellant on 4 March 2004. Further on she said that she believed that there was a person at the respondent who was responsible for ensuring compliance with the agreement between Westpac and the respondent and that that person read the agreement and made sure it was complied with. She later denied, based on the file, that notice of assignment was not sent. <br /><strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>I turn then to the reasons of the Magistrate. Insofar as they concern the ground taken on appeal, and the issue of sending the notice of assignment, the reasons were short, and may be summarised as follows. He first referred to the evidence being that of Ms Cass and documents concerning the Debt Sale Agreement and a document (the computer printout) "tendered as being a schedule of the credit contracts covered by the sale agreement". The evidence of Ms Cass "was that the plaintiff company had bought the debts including that of the defendant in July 2003 and that subsequent notices of assignment of the debt had been sent to the defendant". He then said that insofar as it was an issue he had determined that the respondent had in fact sent the required notices of assignment. <br /><strong>17.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate then observed that save for a minor qualification as to the date on which his credit card application was approved, the appellant admitted the existence of the credit card contract with Westpac. <br /><strong>18.</strong>&nbsp;The Magistrate then turned to deal with the issues, commencing with the appellant’s submission that there was insufficient admissible evidence to establish that the respondent was an assignee of the appellant’s debt to Westpac. As to this, he said:<br />"Insofar as the tendering of the documentary evidence referred to above is concerned, submissions as to the tender of those documents was [sic] made in the course of hearing, the documents were admitted. I do not propose to revisit that decision. It must be said that the documentary chain, if it can be so dignified, is hardly comprehensive given that no evidence was received from Westpac, and the plaintiff’s witness was essentially referring to matters appearing on a file of business papers held by the plaintiff and as to which she had limited personal knowledge and involvement. Be that as it may, the only question I have to consider is whether I can be satisfied on the basis of all of the evidence that the plaintiff was the purchaser and assignee of a debt owed by the defendant to the Westpac Bank. In this respect I note that the Notice of Assignment was signed by Westpac. After some consideration I have reached the conclusion that I can be so satisfied."<br /><strong>19.</strong>&nbsp;The question is whether it was open to the Magistrate acting reasonably to make this finding. <br /><strong>20.</strong>&nbsp;In submitting that the finding was not thus open counsel for the appellant relied on the failure to produce the original or a copy of the Debt Sale Agreement with Annexure A attached or to give evidence explaining non-production. There was, for instance, no evidence of loss or destruction or any other reason explaining why such production was not made. Nor did Ms Cass give evidence of her "inquiries". It was submitted that the non-production of Annexure A, which was the document which identified the debts assigned, meant that the respondent had not established that the appellant’s debt was one of those assigned. Of course secondary evidence of the fact could be given but not without clear and convincing proof of the existence of Annexure A and of its contents by a person able to give personal evidence thereof, as to which see <em>Maks v Maks</em>[2] (secondary evidence of a written agreement constituting a declaration that the defendant held a house property as to one half for the plaintiff); <em>Mack v Lenton</em>[3] (secondary evidence of a lost tenancy agreement), and <em>Masquerade Music Ltd v Springsteen</em>[4] (proof of chain of title to copyrights). I have regard to the discussion in those cases of the approach to the admission of secondary evidence and the reasons for caution in accepting evidence of a document in its absence. This case does not call for elaboration on the matter. <br /><strong>21.</strong>&nbsp;Counsel for the appellant relied on the lack of personal knowledge of Ms Cass of Annexure A, and the failure of the respondent to call evidence from any person with personal knowledge of the assignment or to explain why no such witness was called. In the absence of such evidence the respondent had relied on Ms Cass to give evidence from the file and produce documents including the computer printout and, on that basis, together with the admission of the credit card facility and the debt, to infer the assignment of the appellant’s debt. It was submitted that the evidence of Ms Cass did not constitute secondary evidence of the contents of Annexure A. Thus there was no secondary evidence of that annexure. Further, the existence of the assignment could not be inferred from the proforma notice of assignment. The result was that the respondent had not proved the assignment of the appellant’s debt. It followed that there was no evidentiary basis for the finding of the learned Magistrate that the debt had been assigned. <br /><strong>22.</strong>&nbsp;It is evident from the reasons of the learned Magistrate that he was well aware of, and bore in mind, the limited nature of the evidence, and that he arrived at his conclusion in that light. <br /><strong>23.</strong>&nbsp;Further, the Magistrate correctly identified the question as one that turned on the sufficiency of admissible evidence. It was not submitted that there was a lack of <em>bona fides </em>in the evidence. Nor was it submitted that Ms Cass was an unreliable witness whose evidence should for that reason not be accepted. Rather, the point taken in the course of the giving of the evidence was that Annexure A was not produced notwithstanding which, as the Magistrate noted, he admitted the documents referred to above. <br /><strong>24.</strong>&nbsp;In the passage quoted above the Magistrate posed as the question for consideration whether he could be satisfied on the basis of all of the evidence that the respondent was the purchaser and assignee of the debt owed by the appellant to Westpac. As the case was left for his consideration, that correctly stated the issue. <br /><strong>25.</strong>&nbsp;I note that in the written submission provided to the Magistrate by counsel for the appellant it was submitted that the Debt Sale Agreement was not admissible as in the absence of Annexure A it was not the complete agreement. At the time of the trial however all that counsel for the appellant said was that the document was not complete because the annexure was not attached and counsel asked if the annexure was being tendered. To this counsel for the respondent indicated that he did not have the annexure and moved to the computer printout. That is all that was said. In that limited way the absence of the annexure was explained (although it was not explained why counsel did not have it) and the evidence moved on. The document was admitted. The objection to admissibility subsequently made, and made to me, was not made in terms to the Magistrate at that point. In my view the document could be admitted notwithstanding the unexplained absence of the annexure. How far it went to establishing the case was another matter. The tender occurred at a very early stage in the hearing as the case was beginning to unfold and at a time when the Magistrate would not have known what further evidence was to come on the matter of establishing the assignment of the appellant’s debt. <br /><strong>26.</strong>&nbsp;The next step in the evidence was the evidence as to and production of the computer printout. This was produced in response to a question from counsel for the respondent. This was the question which referred to Ms Cass having made inquiries in respect of the matter and to the computer printout she produced including the appellant’s debt concerned with "this particular agreement". No objection was taken to the question and answer. Ms Cass went on to identify the amount owed by the appellant in July 2003. It was then that the point was taken that the computer printout was not a document referred to in the Debt Sale Agreement. That was correct, and the contrary was not suggested by counsel for the respondent. Nevertheless the Magistrate described Ms Cass’s evidence as being that the respondent "had bought the debts including that of the defendant in July 2003 ...". In so stating the evidence it is clear that he accepted it as amounting to that stated. <br /><strong>27.</strong>&nbsp;I have considered the authorities to which counsel for the appellant referred. I take account of the cautionary statements therein as to the need for cogent evidence of a document that affects a right to property. I take account also of the requirement of writing for a legal assignment in s 134 of the <em>Property Law Act </em>1958, and of the absence of Annexure A and the failure to explain that absence. Taking account of all such matters, and all that counsel submitted, I am nevertheless of the view that it was open to the Magistrate to be satisfied that Westpac had assigned the appellant’s debt to the respondent. <br /><strong>28.</strong>&nbsp;In so concluding the Magistrate said that he was satisfied on the balance of all of the evidence. In my view that conclusion was open. By the time it concluded the evidence had travelled beyond the stage of production of the Debt Sale Agreement and the computer printout and extended to all of the evidence including that pertaining to sending notice of the assignment to the appellant. Exhibit 2 showed that the notice was signed by Westpac and the respondent and identified as having assigned any debt owed by the appellant to Westpac. There was, as I have observed, no attack on the <em>bona fides </em>of the evidence or cogent reason to doubt its honesty. Standing back and considering the evidence overall, and noting the absence of Annexure A, there was yet sufficient in my view, directly and inferentially, to found the conclusion on the balance of probabilities at which the Magistrate arrived. Or, to put it another way, it cannot be said that the contrary conclusion was the only conclusion open to be made by the Magistrate.<br /><strong>29.</strong>&nbsp;For these reasons the appeal must be dismissed with costs including reserved costs. <br /><strong>30.&nbsp;</strong>I add only that the result in this case should not be taken as indicating that a party seeking to establish a case in which its title to sue, or the right to be enforced, is found in a document, need not produce that document or, in its explained absence, a copy thereof in establishing its claim. Of course all cases depend on their own facts and circumstances and must be determined on the evidence. The present case is no more than a decision on its own particular facts and circumstances.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] See my judgment in <em>Harris v QBE Workers’ Compensation (Vic) Limited</em>, 11 October 1994, unreported, BC9406247 at pp6-7; and <em>Civil Procedure Victoria</em>, Williams, Vol 1, para 58.06.45. <br />[2] (1986) 6 NSWLR 34. <br />[3] (1993) 32 NSWLR 259. <br />[4] (2001) 51 IPR 650.<br /><br /><strong>APPEARANCES: </strong>For the appellant Quiroga: Mr CB Thomson, counsel.

After contacting Cellante, Ms B. drove to Horsham in north-western Victoria and met a Cellante salesperson. On that day, for $55,000.00, and for the first time in her life, she bought from Cellante a house in a nearby town – a house Cellante did not own, which it had agreed orally to buy only days earlier for $25,600.00 and which had been on the market for years. The Director of Consumer Affairs brought a test case against the Cellante property organisation alleging that, when it sold a house to Ms B. it engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct in contravention of ss7(1) and 9(1) of the <em>Fair Trading Act </em>1999. The Director sought an order for damages for Ms B. and an order restraining Cellante from selling properties in the same way in the future. The magistrate found Cellante, on the pretext it owned the house, convinced Ms B. whom it knew to be inexperienced, to buy the house, at a price represented to be reasonable, which was false, and immediately, because the property was in high demand, which was also false. The magistrate upheld the Director’s case and found Cellante had engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct in the way it sold the house to Ms Brown. The Cellante companies, Astvilla Pty Ltd and Perna Pty Ltd, and their general manager, Livio Cellante, were ordered to pay her damages and interest. To protect other buyers in the future, they were also ordered not to make representations in trade or commerce that they are the owners of properties when in fact they are not owners. Upon appeal—<br /><br />HELD: Appeal dismissed. <br />1.&nbsp;The decision of the magistrate and the orders is upheld. Cellante well knew the case the Director put against it. The magistrate made no legal errors in the way he conducted the hearing or dealt with the pleading issues. The findings that Astvilla, Perna and Mr Cellante had engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct were open on the evidence. The magistrate did not misconstrue the legislation and he properly applied the correct legal tests. <br />2.&nbsp;S143(1) of the <em>Fair Trading Act </em>did not allow the magistrate to make orders against Mr Cellante, being an officer of the Cellante companies, as a deemed contravener. This provision applies only to proceedings for an offence, whereas the proceedings brought by the Director were civil in nature. The magistrate’s orders against Mr Cellante were still valid. He correctly decided the prohibitions in the <em>Fair Trading Act </em>against misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct applied directly to employees who, like Mr Cellante, had engaged in such conduct in their employer’s trade or commerce as something more than a mere conduit. <br /><br />BELL J: <br /></strong>1.&nbsp;Kellie Brown was bringing up three young children on the sole parent’s pension in rented premises in a Melbourne suburb. Hearing you could buy a house cheaply on vendor terms, she rang the Cellante property organisation and arranged to see a house in Dimboola, near Horsham in country Victoria. It was only $34,000.00, with weekly repayments less than her current rent. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Ms Brown made the drive to unfamiliar Horsham with her children and an elderly neighbour. When she got there, the salesperson told her the Dimboola house was gone. He showed her two others, which were in very poor condition. Then he showed her a house in nearby Warracknabeal, using keys he had to get in. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;This house seemed ideal for Ms Brown’s needs. The salesperson told her it was about $55,000.00 with low weekly repayments. He said it "was a very popular house and ... [he] could sell [it] no problem at all ... five times over." So, if she wanted it, Ms Brown would have to drive back to Horsham to pay a deposit and sign some paperwork, then return to Melbourne to sign some more paperwork in a few days time. She would not have time to look around the area. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;Fearing she would miss out, Ms Brown drove back to Horsham, paid a deposit (by credit card) and signed a contract note to buy the house. That evening, she returned to Melbourne so she could sign the other papers. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;The owner of the house was not Cellante but someone who had been trying to sell it for years. A few days before showing the house to Ms Brown, Cellante orally agreed to buy it for $25,600.00. Cellante had neither the keys for nor permission to enter the house. Having no more than an oral agreement to buy it for $25,600.00, Cellante sold it to Ms Brown for $55,000.00. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;The Director of Consumer Affairs investigated the transaction. He took exception to the way Cellante sold the house and brought a test case in the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria. He alleged Cellante had taken advantage of Ms Brown – a first home buyer – by pretending to own the house, misleading her about its true worth and creating a false atmosphere of urgency so she would buy it on the spot. This way of selling, the Director contended, constituted misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct in contravention of the Fair Trading Act 1999. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The Director was successful. A magistrate ordered Cellante to pay compensation to Ms Brown[1] and restrained Cellante from selling properties in this way in the future.[2] </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The legal entities in the Cellante organisation were Astvilla Pty Ltd, Perna Pty Ltd and Livio Cellante, their general manager. The Director sued Astvilla, Perna and Mr Cellante, whom I will call together Cellante, unless I need to be specific. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;Cellante now appeals to this Court, alleging the magistrate made these errors of law: the fact findings were not open on the pleadings or the evidence, the legislation was misconstrued and no orders could or should have been made against Mr Cellante.</p>\r\n<p>WERE THE MAGISTRATE’S FINDINGS OPEN ON THE PARTICULARS OF CLAIM? <br />The question really is: were the issues fairly contested between the parties? <br />10.&nbsp;Section 109(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act confines Cellante’s appeal to "a question of law." Therefore Cellante can only succeed on this ground if it is an error of law for a magistrate to make a finding of fact outside the scope of the facts alleged in the particulars of claim. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;There is a distinction between making a finding of fact not open on the evidence, which involves a question of law, and making a finding of fact beyond the scope of the pleadings, which may or may not involve a question of law. To establish that an error of law has been made, it is not enough to establish only that the findings of fact went beyond the particulars. It may be an error of law to make findings in relation to non-particularised facts that were not fairly contested between the parties or in support of a non-pleaded cause of action or defence. But where the factual issues have been fairly contested, a party may be permitted to rely upon the proved facts to establish the pleaded cause of action or defence whether or not those facts were included in the particulars. Before doing so it is desirable, but not legally mandatory, for the particulars, by amendment, to be brought into line with the evidence.[3] </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;I have just addressed this issue from the point of view of an appeal court when hearing an appeal on the ground that the trial court made a finding of fact outside the particulars. This is the position I am in. Similar principles apply to a trial court when a party seeks to lead evidence outside the particulars. This is the position the magistrate was in. These principles were set out by Hunt J in Douglas v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd:[4]<br />"Where a party seeks to lead evidence in support of his pleaded case which is outside the particulars which have been supplied of that case, it is for the trial judge to consider whether such evidence unfairly amounts to a case of which the other party has had insufficient warning... It is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge whether to permit the evidence (subject in some cases to amendment of the particulars, but in any event subject to terms so as to meet any prejudice to the other party) or to hold the party whose particulars were deficient to the issues of fact to be investigated as limited by those particulars... The exercise of that discretion must necessarily depend upon many things, including the amount of warning that the other party has had that such evidence was to the led."</p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;These principles apply in the trade practices context, as is well illustrated by the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd v Miba Pty Ltd.[5] In a misleading and deceptive conduct case, the trial judge found the pleaded claim not to be proven but he found a non-pleaded claim to the proven. Because the defendant had notice that this claim was "in the ring" (the trial judge had mentioned it himself), the trial judge considered the plaintiff should succeed on this basis.[6] Davies, Tamberlin and RD Nicholson JJ dismissed the appeal. Davies J (Tamberlin J agreeing) held he was "satisfied that the ground on which his Honour gave judgment was raised and that it was litigated."[7] Therefore the trial judge was not confined to the pleadings. RD Nicholson J held the defendant had to fail on appeal because it knew the case put against it at trial but chose not to meet it.[8] </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;It can now be seen that, in the appeal before me, the question raised by this ground really is: were the issues fairly contested between the parties? In considering this question, I have to bear in mind that it was for the magistrate, in the exercise of his discretion, to manage the case so as to bring this fair contest about. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;The following description of the conduct of the proceedings before the magistrate shows Cellante knew full-well the nature of the case it was facing and deliberately mounted a narrow defence. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;I begin with the particulars of claim. These were detailed and gave Cellante reasonably precise particulars of the misleading or deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct that the Director intended to prove. In other words, they gave Cellante advance notice of the case it had to meet. The Director also gave Cellante written statements containing the oral evidence he intended to lead from his witnesses. This gave Cellante further notice of the case against it. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;The matter was fully opened by counsel for the Director. Counsel for Cellante objected that the opening went beyond the pleadings. He said Cellante would be answering the case put in the pleadings, not the case put in the opening. Counsel for the Director disputed the objections, but he applied for leave to make certain amendments to clarify the particulars of claim. Against the opposition of counsel for Cellante, the magistrate gave him that leave. In doing so, his Honour made it quite clear he would allow counsel for the Director to proceed with the case as opened.[9] </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;At this point it would have been clear beyond doubt to Cellante that the case was going forward as opened by the Director. But Cellante did not respond to the ruling. It did not modify the conduct of its case at all. It continued to do what its counsel said it would, namely answer the case put in the pleadings and not the opening. It did not try to establish before the magistrate that it was actually prejudiced by the course taken by the Director. Likewise it has not tried to establish before me that the magistrate failed properly to deal with any such prejudice. It did not ask the magistrate for an adjournment. It did not contend it was caught by surprise by the evidence the Director proposed to lead. Counsel for Cellante did not contend, before the magistrate or me, that he was unable properly to cross-examine the Director’s witnesses. Nor did he contend he had evidence available to him to meet the case as opened that was different to the evidence he had come prepared to present. He elected to proceed. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;The evidence was then given in open court in the presence of counsel for Cellante, who had every opportunity to test it by cross-examination, and to present contrary evidence, if he so chose. <br />20.&nbsp;Ms Brown gave evidence in chief orally. Counsel for Cellante cross-examined Ms Brown. He did not challenge important aspects of her evidence in relation to the sequence of events and the representations allegedly made. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;The balance of the evidence given on behalf of the Director was mainly contained in witness statements tendered by consent, supplemented by some oral evidence. This evidence was given mostly without objection by counsel for Cellante. With limited exceptions, the cross-examination of these witnesses was directed to the clarification, rather than to the challenging of this evidence. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;Mr Cellante gave evidence in chief on behalf of Cellante and he was cross-examined by counsel for the Director. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;Mr Wissell gave oral evidence on behalf of Cellante. This evidence was confined to his employment by Vic Properties – the Cellante business name – and the bare details of the discussions he had concerning the purchase of the property by his employer. He was not taken in evidence in chief to the important aspects of the critical events. In particular, he was not taken to the events described in the evidence of Ms Brown. Therefore he did not contradict her account of what happened. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;At various stages during the hearing, counsel for Cellante objected to questions or made submissions on the basis that the Director was conducting a case outside the pleadings. An example is the evidence of Ms Brown in relation to the representations made to her by Mr Wissell and Mr Cellante. These objections were, in substance, re-runs of the ones rejected by the magistrate at the start of the case. They were not based on any new foundation. No actual prejudice was demonstrated by Cellante. The objections were all rejected. Again, if he was caught by surprise by any aspect of the evidence presented on behalf of the Director, counsel for Cellante could easily have requested an adjournment. He did not do so. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;The issues of fact raised by the evidence, as regards the alleged potential liability of the two companies, Astvilla and Perna, and Mr Cellante personally, were extensively addressed in the closing submissions made by counsel for the Director and Cellante to the magistrate, both orally and in writing. With limited exceptions that I will deal with below, the findings of the magistrate were based on the evidence given at the hearing, which was the subject of those submissions, His Honour only made findings in relation to matters that had been contested at the hearing, again, as regards the companies and Mr Cellante personally. At all times the Director kept his case to the causes of action specified in the particulars of claim, namely misleading or deceptive, and, unconscionable conduct. The magistrate made findings only in relation to those causes of action. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;The conduct of the proceedings before the magistrate shows that the issues of fact about which the magistrate made findings were fairly contested between the parties. The magistrate properly managed the case to ensure that such a fair contest would occur. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;For reasons which I will now give, there were in any event no significant differences between the facts pleaded and the facts found. </p>\r\n<p>There were no substantial differences between the facts alleged in the particulars of claim and the findings of fact made by the magistrate.<br />Cellante’s submissions<br />28.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted there were substantial differences between the facts alleged in the particulars of claim and the findings of fact made by the magistrate, indeed so substantial that, in effect, the magistrate upheld a claim not made by the Director. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;A comparison of the facts alleged and the findings made reveals this submission to be incorrect. Although there are some differences between the two, they are not significant. The differences are certainly insufficient to justify the submission that the magistrate upheld a case not put. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;The following paragraphs set out the allegations of fact in the particulars of claim and the findings of fact of the magistrate. Then the two are then compared to show that the findings sprung from the case put in the particulars.</p>\r\n<p>The allegations of fact in the particulars of claim<br />31.&nbsp;The further amended complaint sets out the particulars of claim in 42 detailed paragraphs (plus a further 9 paragraphs relating to the relief claimed). The document is too long to set out here. The nature of the factual allegations emerges sufficiently from the following summary of the main paragraphs. </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;Paragraph 7 made allegations in relation to Ms Brown’s personal circumstances. It alleged that Ms Brown was a single mother with three children, not working, in receipt of the sole parent’s pension, inexperienced in commercial arrangements, a first home buyer, a person with limited formal education and minimal assets and unaware of the prices of comparative properties in the Warracknabeal area. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;Paragraph 12 alleged a conversation took place between a Cellante employee, Jeanette Porto, and Ms Brown. It alleged Ms Brown told Ms Porto she was eligible for the first home buyer’s grant, was not working, was on the pension, was struggling to meet her present rent of $200.00 per week and wanted to buy a property with repayments of not more than $130.00 per week. Ms Porto told Ms Brown someone in her circumstances (being on a pension and not working) could buy a property, the grant would be taken into account in any deposit payable and that she would send a brochure and list of properties to her. </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;Paragraphs 13 – 17 made allegations in relation to the arrangements made by Ms Brown to visit Horsham to view a property. It was alleged a brochure was sent to Ms Brown, who then arranged with Cellante to meet a salesperson, Mr Wissell, at Horsham to inspect a house in Dimboola on 17 June 2001. Ms Brown again described her personal circumstances, this time to Mr Wissell. It was alleged he told her the house in Dimboola had been sold but a number of others in her repayment bracket were available for purchase on vendor terms, and he could show these to her. He did so, including the house at Warracknabeal. </p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;Paragraph 19 made allegations in relation to what Mr Wissell told Ms Brown after she expressed interested in the house. The particulars of claim described these matters as the first representations and they are set out here:<br />"19(a) [The] price of the property was $55,000 by vendor terms but a reduction in price to $53,000 could be obtained for an early final settlement; <br />(b) the property had just come on the market and would be in demand; <br />(c) the property could be purchased on vendor terms; <br />(d) he could sell the property five times over at the price; <br />(e) she should immediately commit to purchasing the property because it was in demand; <br />(f) she would have to commit and sign up for it that day if she wanted to secure the property; <br />(g) the property was in good condition; <br />(h) the price of the property was fair and reasonable; <br />(i) she would have to pay a deposit of $2,000.00 at the time of committing to the property; <br />(j) Livio, his boss, had the last word on the sale price of the property; <br />(k) Livio had the last word on the amount of weekly payments."</p>\r\n<p>36.&nbsp;Paragraph 21 made allegations in relation to what Mr Cellante told Ms Brown by telephone before she committed to buying the house. The particulars described these matters as the second representations and they are:</p>\r\n<p>"21(a) [Mr Cellante] congratulated Brown on selecting the property; <br />(b) confirmed she could buy the property on vendor terms; <br />(c) advised that her repayments would – <br />(i) be $125 per week for the first 6 months; <br />(ii) be $135 per week for the following 6 months; <br />(iii) increase each year by $10 until final settlement. <br />(d) advised that the property was in good condition; <br />(e) advised that the price for the property was fair and reasonable; <br />(f) advised that the property was in demand; <br />(g) advised that she should commit by signing immediately to buy the property otherwise she could lose the property; <br />(h) advised and arranged for her to attend the first and/or second defendant’s offices in Templestowe on 21 June 2001 to complete the formalities."</p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;Paragraph 22 made allegations about what was implicit in the first and second representations:<br />"22(a) [Vic Properties] was the owner of the property; <br />(b) Vic Properties was entitled to sell the property; <br />(c) Vic Properties was in a position to sell the property; <br />(d) Vic Properties was the registered proprietor of the property or entitled to be registered as the proprietor of the property."</p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;Paragraph 23 alleged Ms Brown was induced by these representations into signing the contract note and paying a deposit of $1000.00 on 17 June 2001. </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;Paragraph 28 alleged that the first and second representations were false and misleading because:<br />"28(a) the property was not in demand; <br />(b) the property had been on the market for about four years prior to the date with an asking price of $32,000.00; <br />(c) the price paid by Brown for the property was not fair and reasonable; <br />(d) the property was not in good condition, in that, its roof required replacement or repair and the building required restumping."</p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;The particulars of claim alleged Ms Brown was deprived of the opportunity to look around the area and to acquaint herself with comparative prices (paragraph 29). It made certain allegations about the application of the provisions of s3(1)(b) of the Sale of Land Act 1962 in circumstances where, as here, Cellante was selling on terms a property that it did not own (paragraph 27). </p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;It was alleged a further misrepresentation was made to Ms Brown, this time by Ms Porto, that the property had no easements attached to it when it did (paragraphs 32 and 33). <br />42.&nbsp;It was alleged in paragraph 33 that Ms Brown was induced into signing a terms contract for the property on 21 June 2001 by the main elements of the first and second representations, the further representation about the easement and a representation that she could take possession of the property when she had paid all of the deposit. </p>\r\n<p>43.&nbsp;The pleading then made allegations of facts about the completion of the transaction and the loss suffered by Ms Brown. </p>\r\n<p>44.&nbsp;That is enough description of the particulars of claim. Now let me turn to the findings of the magistrate.</p>\r\n<p>The findings of fact of the magistrate<br />45.&nbsp;The findings of fact of the magistrate are in the reasons for decision dated 22 June 2004, which are lengthy. They give a detailed account of the background circumstances (paragraphs 1-87) and then set out the findings of fact and consideration of the alleged contravening conduct (see especially paragraphs 88-129). </p>\r\n<p>46.&nbsp;These were his Honours main findings:<br />"Findings of fact <br />88. It is not contested that Ms Brown, as at 17 June 2001: <br />a. had a limited education <br />b. had no experience in clerical matters <br />c had never purchased a home previously <br />d. had very limited financial resources <br />e. had not consulted a solicitor or conveyancer <br />f. had no knowledge of house prices in Warracknabeal <br />g. had no knowledge of house prices generally.<br />89. No explanation was given as to why Ms Brown was not told before she visited Horsham that the Dimboola property had been sold. Ms Brown was enticed to visit Horsham by the defendant companies’ employee Ms Porto, on the pretext that the Dimboola property could be sold to her. <br />90. No explanation was given as to why the Horsham meeting was scheduled for a Sunday. Because of the opinion I have formed of the defendant companies’ conduct, the view I take is the meeting was purposefully scheduled for a Sunday so as Ms Brown could not have access to other estate agents or other relevant sources of information. <br />91. There was no prospect that Ms Brown would be interested in the Jeparit properties given their state of repair. The opinion I have formed of Mr Wisell’s conduct is such that it is my view he showed Ms Brown these properties for 2 reasons: to make 17 Bowman Street look more attractive price-wise and to delay getting to Warracknabeal and so frustrating any effort Ms Brown might make to look around. <br />92. There is no evidence before me to even suggest the defendant companies had any right at all to sell 12 Bowman Street. In fact the overwhelming evidence is to the contrary. At best there was a non-binding verbal agreement. The defendant companies were not authorised to conduct inspections. The evidence is that Mr Wissell was not provided with a key yet he found his way onto the property using his own keys. <br />93. On 17 June 2001 the defendant companies through Mr Wissell and Mr Cellante and Mr Cellante personally represented to Ms Brown that they were in a position to sell her the property. <br />... <br />97. By creating a climate of urgency Mr Wissell deprived Ms Brown of any opportunity to look around the Warracknabeal area before signing the contract note. Such an inspection may have given Ms Brown an opportunity to look in estate-agent’s windows and see the prices of comparable homes. <br />98. As to Mr Cellante’s role in the events of 17 June 2001, he knew the defendant companies had no legal interest in the property. He also knew the price at which one of the companies could purchase the property. His conversations with Ms Brown encouraged her to believe she had bought the property, whereas his evidence was that she had done no more than order the property. He was anxious to have her visit him to sign a contract of sale. It also appears that he needed to delay her visit to enable one of the companies to secure the property. <br />... <br />101. The most reliable guide to the value of 17 Bowman Street in June 2004 is the figure Perna Pty Ltd was prepared to pay and Mr Taylor was prepared to sell to accept viz. $25,000. Mr Taylor had been trying to sell for a long time. He may have been anxious, he was also acutely aware of the lack of interest by prospective purchasers. The valuation of the local valuer, Mr Wilson, is to be preferred to the valuation of Mr Hocking who inspected only this property in the area and based his valuation on other Cellante sales. I accept Mr Hadley’s valuation of plus or minus $25.00 made on 6 June 2001. <br />... <br />107. Mr Cellante acknowledged that the sale of 17 Bowman Street by Perna Pty Ltd to Ms Brown breached section 3(1)(b) of the Sale of Land Act 1958. He said since he has taken the advice of his and the companies’ solicitors, the companies comply with the legislation. <br />... <br />109. The manner in which Mr Cellante and Mr Wissell conducted themselves during the transaction also must be taken into account in assessing the reliability of their evidence. I refer to matters admitted or not contradicted like the Dimboola property not being available, the keys Mr Wissell used to get into the house, Mr Wissell not having any right to inspect the property, the disparity in price, the Cellante group not owning the property etc. <br />... <br />Misleading and deceptive conduct <br />... <br />113. Mr Cellante disputes that he, as an employee of the two companies, was engaged in ‘trade or commerce’. It is clear that Mr Cellante was the person controlling and directing the sale to Ms Brown. He is not like Mr Wissell who, although most likely very anxious that the sale be effected, did not have the final say. Mr Cellante controlled and directed the purchase from Mr Taylor and the sale to Ms Brown. As he said in answer to Question 31 in his record of interview ‘Well I prepared the contract. I was involved with the negotiations with the client. Yeah’. <br />114. Mr Cellante was more than a mere conduit. He was the main player. <br />115. Mr Cellante, on 17 June 2001, engaged in conduct, together with Mr Wissell, which resulted in Ms Brown believing that she had purchased a property which was in demand and that she would get possession of the property within a short period of time. This being a property in which none of the defendants had any proprietary right; but they knew could be purchased for $25,600 on a 180 day contract. It was misleading and deceptive for the defendants to represent that they could sell the property to Ms Brown and that she could move in on payment of the first home buyer’s grant. <br />116. Ms Brown left the Horsham area believing that she had purchased a home for herself and her 3 children at a price that was fair and reasonable, that they would on payment of the first home buyer’s grant be living in it and that her weekly rental of $200 would reduce to $130. <br />117. It is fair to draw the conclusion Ms Brown believed the price to be fair and reasonable. She was afforded no opportunity to make her own enquiries. She had no option but to accept Mr Cellante’s representation that it was a good buy. All sellers tell would-be purchasers that they are getting a bargain. That can be puffery if it is in the nature of ‘introductory comments, in the nature of puffery, made at the start of negotiations, for the purpose of attracting the interest of a possible purchaser. As such they became irrelevant or of little, if any, significance when detailed information is subsequently given ...’. See Pappas v Soulac Pty Ltd 50 ALR 231 Fisher J at page 241. <br />118. The representation as to price, in this instance, goes far beyond puffery. Working on the lesser sum mentioned in the contract note of $53,000 and keeping in mind that the property can be purchased from the true owner for $25,600 and Ms Brown knows nothing of the price of houses in the area and is kept ignorant, the defendants cannot be heard to say the representation as to price is puffery. The efforts to keep Ms Brown ignorant continued on when the contract of sale was prepared with vital material excised. <br />119. The fact that Ms Brown, on 21 June 2004, entered into a contract of sale on different terms exacerbates the problem. It shows that the defendants never intended to honour the representations made on 17 June 2001, and recorded in the contract note, that she would have possession on payment of the first home buyer’s grant. There was no evidence that Ms Brown asked for the changes. <br />120. Relying on the representations made on 17 June Ms Brown attended at Cellante’s and left having entered into a less advantageous agreement than the one she had been promised. An agreement more favourable to the defendant companies. <br />121. It can be fairly said if Ms Brown had been able to acquaint herself with the truth of the matter as to the price Perna Pty Ltd paid, when it acquired the property and when it had to settle on the property, she would not have signed the contract of sale. In signing she relied on the representations of Mr Wissell, Mr Cellante and Ms Porto. <br />... <br />124 All three defendants have contravened Section 9. <br />Unconscionable conduct<br />...<br />126 In considering the liability of the defendants under this sub-section the only additional matter I need to consider is whether Ms Brown was under a special disability or special disadvantage when she signed the contract note and the contract of sale.<br />...<br />128 Ms Brown was ignorant and inexperienced in real estate dealings in the Warracknabeal area and the defendants created an atmosphere that kept her that way on 17 and 21 June 2001.<br />129 All three defendants have contravened Section 7..." </p>\r\n<p>Comparing the two<br />47.&nbsp;A comparison of the allegations of fact in the particulars of claim and the findings of fact of the magistrate reveals no significant difference between the two. </p>\r\n<p>48.&nbsp;The particulars of claim described the alleged facts in narrative terms. In outline, the narrative was that Ms Brown arranged with Cellante to go to Horsham to inspect the Dimboola property, she met with Mr Wissell who told her it was sold, he showed her other properties including the one in Warracknabeal, she had conversations with Mr Wissell and Mr Cellante in relation to buying that property, in reliance on certain misrepresentations Ms Brown decided to buy it and she returned to Horsham to sign a contract note and to Melbourne to sign a contract. Of course this is a selection of the essential elements, but it demonstrates my point. </p>\r\n<p>49.&nbsp;The reasons for decision of the magistrate also described the found facts in narrative terms, indeed by reference to the same outline facts alleged in the particulars of claim, some of which I have set out. <br />50.&nbsp;Cellante’s complaint does not concern these outline facts but, especially, the specifics of what the particulars alleged Ms Brown was told and by whom. </p>\r\n<p>51.&nbsp;Cellante’s submissions go into microscopic detail on this subject and it is unnecessary for me to set them out here. I have examined the submissions. They point to no more than the kind of insignificant departure between the facts as particularised in the pleadings and the facts as found by a trial court on the evidence as is commonly found in such cases. The submissions do not show the magistrate upheld a case not pleaded. </p>\r\n<p>52.&nbsp;The submissions would be on stronger ground if the substance of the case pleaded was different to the substance of the case found proven. The substance of the case pleaded against the companies and Mr Cellante was that they, on the pretext Cellante (though Vic Properties) was the owner, convinced Ms Brown, whom they knew to be inexperienced, to buy the property, immediately, and at a price falsely represented to be fair and reasonable, otherwise she would miss out on the sale, for the property was in high demand, which was also false (see especially paragraphs 19-3, 26-29 and 33 of the particulars of claim). This was the case the magistrate found proven against them. </p>\r\n<p>53.&nbsp;In certain limited respects the magistrate’s findings went beyond the particulars of claim. For example, his Honour made adverse findings about Cellante enticing Ms Brown to visit Horsham to look at a property in Dimboola, which had been sold, and about Cellante showing her other properties, which it knew to be unsuitable. </p>\r\n<p>54.&nbsp;These findings were legitimate responses by the magistrate to the evidence – which Cellante had the opportunity to contest – and filled in some aspects of the narrative left partly open by the particulars (see paragraphs 17-18). In these and in no other respects did the magistrate’s findings go beyond the particulars to uphold a case not put. </p>\r\n<p>55.&nbsp;This ground of the appeal must therefore be rejected.</p>\r\n<p>Were the misrepresentations particularised with sufficient precision?<br />56.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante put forward an additional basis for his submission that the Director’s case, and the magistrate’s findings, had gone outside the particulars of claim. He submitted that, in cases involving misleading or deceptive conduct, and unconscionable, conduct based on misrepresentation, the alleged misrepresentation has to be identified with precision. Therefore, the Director could succeed only if he proved a misrepresentation specified, with precision, in the particulars. Moreover, the magistrate could not give the Director a victory by finding Cellante had made a different misrepresentation. Since the magistrate had done exactly this, so it was submitted, he made an error of law. </p>\r\n<p>57.&nbsp;In the present case the Director alleged Cellante engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct by making misrepresentations. In such a case the plaintiff must identify the misrepresentations with precision.[10] If this is not done, the action may be struck out for failing to disclose a cause of action.[11] </p>\r\n<p>58.&nbsp;Where the alleged misrepresentation was made in writing, it will usually be easy, by reference to the document, to identify the misrepresentation with precision. Where the alleged misrepresentation was made orally, the precise identification of the misrepresentation may be more difficult. </p>\r\n<p>59.&nbsp;The requirement to particularise the alleged misrepresentations with precision is an important one and the onus to do so rests upon the plaintiff. But there are degrees of precision and the degree required must surely take into account the circumstances of the given case. It would be wrong to equate the precise with the exact. Where the alleged misrepresentations were made orally, it may not ever be possible to particularise them exactly. The plaintiff has to prove their case. But Cellante’s approach to the requirement for precision would reserve success in this kind of case to those with perfect recall. </p>\r\n<p>60.&nbsp;The magistrate considered the particulars provided by the Director. He decided that anybody reading them would have a clear idea of the Director’s complaint and the remedy he sought. He rejected the submissions of counsel for Cellante in this respect and, in my view, he made no error of law in doing so. </p>\r\n<p>61.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted that, in so deciding, the magistrate misdirected himself in applying the decision of Eames J (as his Honour them was) in Intrac (Sales) Pty Ltd v Riverside Plumbing &amp; Gas Fitting Pty Ltd.[12] This case decided that the Magistrates’ Court is a court of pleading, although the pleading rules apply less strictly in that court than in the higher courts. [13] </p>\r\n<p>62.&nbsp;The Magistrates’ Court has rules that require a plaintiff to provide, among other things, a concise statement of the nature of, and particulars of, the claim.[14] But consistently with the summary nature of the jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Court, these rules, when compared with the rules of the higher courts, strike a different balance between the need for procedural formality and the need for cost-effective determination of the case. As the magistrate said in the present case, if the Magistrates’ Court rigidly followed the procedures of the higher courts, it would give up its ability to deal with cases summarily, and there would be little place for it in the judicial hierarchy. </p>\r\n<p>63.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted Intrac was indistinguishable from the present case. This submission is incorrect. </p>\r\n<p>64.&nbsp;In Intrac, the plaintiff alleged in the particulars of claim that an advertisement had incorrectly represented a second-hand machine to have worked for 2,600 hours when it had actually worked for 13,000 hours. In its defence the defendant admitted representing that the machine had worked for about 4,500 hours. In the evidence at the hearing, the plaintiff referred again to 2,600 hours and defendant referred again to about 4,500 hours. In other words, the plaintiff never conducted the case, in the particulars or in the evidence, upon the basis that the representation was about 4500 hours. Without notice to the parties, the magistrate held that the representation was about 4,500 hours; and she used expert evidence that the actual hours of work were 6000 hours as the basis of a compensation order made against the defendant. In these circumstances, Eames J held the magistrate had made an error of law by making a finding not supported by the particulars of claim. </p>\r\n<p>65.&nbsp;As this analysis reveals, Intrac was a case in which the magistrate made findings in relation to matters not fairly contested between the parties. </p>\r\n<p>66.&nbsp;In the present case, the allegations of fact in the Director’s particulars of claim sufficiently encompassed the case advanced at the hearing by the Director and the findings made by the magistrate. The factual issues determined by the magistrate were also fully canvassed between the parties. As counsel for the Director submitted, the magistrate’s findings did not, like the finding of 6000 actual hours of work in Intrac, come out of the blue. </p>\r\n<p>67.&nbsp;The submissions of counsel for Cellante seemed to treat Intrac as authority for the proposition that it is an error of law for a trial court to make a finding of fact in the face of an imprecisely particularised misrepresentation. This confuses a rule that governs the pleadings with the separate rules, which I dealt with earlier, that govern the conduct of the trial. Eames J himself distinguished between the two.[15] </p>\r\n<p>68.&nbsp;For these reasons the magistrate did not misapply the decision in Intrac.</p>\r\n<p>WERE THE FINDINGS OF FACT OF THE MAGISTRATE OPEN ON THE EVIDENCE?<br />An error of fact is not necessarily an error of law <br />69.&nbsp;Cellante’s submissions on this ground were made in writing and developed orally. The written submissions were made in the outline of submissions (with annexures A and B) dated 10 January 2004. These drew heavily on Cellante’s outline of final submissions dated 23 April 2004, response to the Director’s outline of submissions to the magistrate dated 7 May 2004 and further response dated 13 May 2004, all three to the magistrate. Annexures A and B of Cellante’s outline to this Court are, respectively, a chronology and a paragraph by paragraph analysis of the factual basis of the reasons for decision of the magistrate. (In response to questions raised by the Court, Cellante also filed with the Court a supplementary outline of argument dated 22 February 2005 and further supplementary outlines of argument dated 23 February 2005, 27 February 2006 and 22 June 2006.) </p>\r\n<p>70.&nbsp;These submissions invite me to engage in an analysis of the pleadings and the evidence presented to, and the facts found by, the magistrate. There are important constraints upon the power of the Court to do so. As I have noted, an appeal under s109(1) of the Magistrates’ Court Act must be confined to a question of law. In such an appeal it is not part of the Court’s function to determine whether a finding of fact by a magistrate was right or wrong. The function of finding the facts is performed exclusively by the magistrate. In a case where a question of law is said to be involved in a finding of fact by a magistrate, as in limited circumstances it can, the function of the Court is to determine whether there was any evidence upon which the magistrate could have made the finding, which excludes an appeal on the ground that the finding was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence.[16] </p>\r\n<p>71.&nbsp;This point is frequently made by the Court. Yet all too often appeals are brought on questions dressed up as questions of law that are really questions of fact. This case is one of them. For the reasons I now give, and despite certain errors made by the magistrate, penetration of the dense thicket of Cellante’s submissions on this ground does not reveal that an error of law was involved in the way the facts were found by the magistrate. <br />72.&nbsp;Again, it is necessary to make a comparison, this time of the evidence with the findings.</p>\r\n<p>The evidence<br />73.&nbsp;The evidence, in summary, and on the main points in issue, was as follows. </p>\r\n<p>74.&nbsp;The most important evidence for the Director was that of Ms Brown. She told the magistrate she was a single parent with three young children and received the sole parent’s pension. She left school when she was fourteen and went to a home for children. She worked as a waitress in a variety of places. She did so in the United Kingdom from aged 16 until 21 and then in Australia until aged 23, when she fell pregnant with her first child. </p>\r\n<p>75.&nbsp;Her evidence was she rang Cellante and spoke to Ms Porto about buying a property on vendor terms. She did not understand what this meant except that you had to pay the vendor back for the house. She told Ms Porto she was a single mother on the pension paying rent of $200.00 per week that was "breaking me." She said it would be great to save that money and get a house. Ms Porto asked whether she had ever received a home buyer’s grant. She replied no - being on a pension, she had never bought a house. She asked Ms Porto to send her some pamphlets and some literature arrived two days later. It contained lists of properties, photographs, write-ups and repayment details. </p>\r\n<p>76.&nbsp;Ms Brown said that she was really interested in one house in Dimboola on a one acre block for $34,000.00. She had the repayment page for that one and it looked perfect. So she telephoned Ms Porto to arrange to see it. Ms Porto arranged for her to meet Mr Wissell at Horsham at 10.00am on Sunday 17 June 2001. She drove up the day before with her children and neighbour, John Wood, who was aged about eighty-seven. </p>\r\n<p>77.&nbsp;She deposed that they met Mr Wissell as arranged. She had to talk to him about vendor terms and this was part of their conversation. He asked her what repayment bracket she fell into and she said no more than $130.00 – $135.00 per week. She told him that she wanted to look at the house in Dimboola shown in the sheet of paper she had. He said it was gone. He crossed off that house, and others, from the list, leaving only expensive ones. </p>\r\n<p>78.&nbsp;Mr Wissell told her there were cheaper ones she could look at. She agreed to do so and went with him to two houses in Jeparit. The first was appalling with sunken floors. It was $43,000.00 and you would not put a rat in it, she told the magistrate. (She said in cross-examination it was a "pig sty.") The second was shocking, only slightly better. The houses needed restumping and thousands of dollars spent on them. </p>\r\n<p>79.&nbsp;Then they all went to lunch at the Jeparit Hotel. Mr Wissell paid. He was "pumping up" a third house which he said was very nice and perfect for her and the children. This was the house at 11 Bowman Street, Warracknabeal. They went to see it at about 3.45pm. When they arrived he made sure the house was empty and then invited her to inspect it. He produced a bunch of keys and opened the door. Mr Brown found it to be very nice inside and recently cleaned. (She said in cross-examination it was "immaculate in comparison.") The children were very excited. Mr Wissell told her that the house was available on vendor terms in her price bracket. He said the price was $53,000.00 - $55,000.00, which she found baffling. She was told that if the house settled within the first six months it would be $53,000.00. He told her about vendor terms and the payment schedules and whether or not she could afford it. He said that once the vendor terms went through, they would help her get finance to settle quickly with Cellante. </p>\r\n<p>80.&nbsp;Ms Brown told the magistrate she had never been to Warracknabeal and was not aware of house prices in the area. She did not discuss "the value of the house" with Mr Wissell. </p>\r\n<p>81.&nbsp;Mr Wissell said to hold the house would require a deposit of $2000.00. She said she did not have it. Her evidence was that Mr Wissell then said: "[The] house was a very popular house and that he could sell that house no problems at all. He actually said that he could sell the house five times over." Ms Brown deposed that she told Mr Wissell she wanted to buy the house. </p>\r\n<p>82.&nbsp;Then Mr Wissell rang Mr Cellante and put Ms Brown on the phone. Ms Brown told the magistrate that Mr Cellante "congratulated me, told me what a wonderful house I’d got, that it was a good house." </p>\r\n<p>83.&nbsp;Ms Brown’s evidence was she wanted to stay to make sure it was a nice town and check everything to make sure it was right. But Mr Wissell said she had to follow him back to Horsham to sign the paperwork. She followed him there, having been at the house for about half an hour. Her words to the magistrate were:<br />"He wanted me to go to [Horsham] as quickly as possible and we had to sign the contract note. So we – we went back to the office...I believe that if I didn’t sign this note quickly, I was led to believe that this house would be snapped up over night. So we went straight down there and did the paperwork and then it was mine. So, I ... went down there, signed it..."</p>\r\n<p>84.&nbsp;Ms Brown said she had a second conversation with Mr Cellante while she was at Horsham with Mr Wissell. He called him on his mobile and put her on. She had to speak to Mr Cellante because only he could confirm the repayments would not exceed $130.00. Here is her testimony about that conversation:<br />"[First] of all he congratulated me on purchasing the house, told me it was a good house, I’d done well, there was lots of bubbly feelings. Then he told me the repayment schedules for the first six months would be $125.00, the following six months they would be $135.00... <br />He told me that he needed me to go down to the office very quickly, to sign the vendor terms contract. How quickly would I be back and how quickly could I get down to him ... I wanted to stay around a little while and have a bit of a look around...He wasn’t too keen about that, he said that wasn’t the way that they did business. That it is important for me to go down to sign this contract and to do all the formalities. So we arranged for me to go down on the following Thursday, which was the 21st..."</p>\r\n<p>85.&nbsp;She said she signed the contract note but did not read it. She filled in only her name and telephone number. Otherwise Mr Wissell filled it out for her to sign. He told her everything was dependant on the $7000.00 home grant going through. He told her there was no problem with her moving in as soon as the grant was approved. Her evidence was that she was led to believe this was the document that bought her the house. She said nobody forced her to sign the contract note, but: "If I walked away, I would have lost the house. They would have sold it the next day." The deposit was reduced to $1000.00, which she paid by credit card. </p>\r\n<p>86.&nbsp;She told the magistrate she went back to look at the house briefly before returning to Melbourne that evening. </p>\r\n<p>87.&nbsp;As arranged, Ms Brown went to Cellante’s Melbourne offices on Thursday 21 June 2005. She signed the contract of sale on vendor terms. This was to finalise the details of buying the house. It was a quick process with Ms Porto. She gave evidence about the price being $58,000.00. She said she paid $58,000.00 because she felt pressured. She also gave evidence about the delay in the settlement of the transaction and obtaining a bank loan. </p>\r\n<p>88.&nbsp;In cross-examination, Ms Brown was not challenged in relation to any significant aspect of her evidence. Aspects of Mr Cellante’s later evidence in chief were not consistent with Ms Brown’s evidence. Counsel for Cellante must have known this evidence was coming when he cross-examined Ms Brown. Yet he did not put these inconsistencies to her. </p>\r\n<p>89.&nbsp;The owner of the house, Warren Taylor, gave evidence on behalf of the Director, partly in a statement admitted into evidence by consent and partly in oral testimony. He said he bought the house in about 1984/1985 for $37,500.00. He had had it on the market for 10 years. He agreed to sell it to Cellante for $25,600.00. </p>\r\n<p>90.&nbsp;Ian Wilson gave valuation evidence on behalf of the Director. His evidence was that his area of expertise was the valuation of properties in the northern part of the Western District, the Wimmera and the Mallee, which is the area in which the Bowman Street property was situated. He valued the property at $26,000.00, excluding GST. In cross-examination he said his valuation assumed a purchaser was well informed and prudent about local market conditions. His valuation was on the basis of a purchase on normal terms and conditions, not vendor terms. </p>\r\n<p>91.&nbsp;Mr Cellante gave evidence on behalf of Cellante. He said that although he was not a director or shareholder of Astvilla and Perna, he was involved in their business operations. His role in these companies was to handle the legal matters and buy and sell properties. He oversaw the conveyancing but was not a qualified solicitor. Mr Wissell was a Cellante employee. Ms Porto was an Astvilla employee but worked for both companies as a sales manager. </p>\r\n<p>92.&nbsp;Mr Cellante told the magistrate in 2001 he was under the mistaken belief that if Cellante was buying a property for cash, it could sell for cash or on terms, but that if it were buying on terms, it could sell for cash but not on terms. He now appreciated that if Cellante was selling on terms, it had to be the registered proprietor or entitled to be so registered. </p>\r\n<p>93.&nbsp;His evidence was there was a verbal agreement between Cellante and Mr Taylor to buy the Warracknabeal property for $25,600.00 on 14 June 2001. A contract note was signed on 19 June 2001. He also gave evidence in relation to the preparation of the terms contract of sale of the property to Ms Brown and her signing of that contract and about the reasons for the increase in the price to $58,000.00, which were related to her not paying a $4,000.00 deposit. </p>\r\n<p>94.&nbsp;Ms Brown was not cross-examined about the conversations she had with Mr Cellante in 17 June 2001. Over the objection of counsel for the Director, Mr Cellante gave evidence about the first of these. He said that he explained to Ms Brown the need for a $4,000.00 deposit. He said he told her that if she paid $1000.00 now, it would take her 24 weeks at repayments of $125.00 per week to build up a deposit and she would not get possession until the full deposit and the first home buyers grant were paid, that is, not until 7 December. </p>\r\n<p>95.&nbsp;Under cross-examination, Mr Cellante said the sequence was that Mr Wissell filled out the contract note then Ms Brown got Mr Wissell to ring him so she could speak to him because "before she signed she rang to confirm that she could buy." Then she signed the contract note. He did not know what Mr Wissell told Ms Brown because he was not present. He agreed when he first spoke to her he congratulated her on her purchase. He believed it was the first time Ms Brown had bought a home and this was a significant issue for her. Ms Porto knew that Ms Brown was a resident of Melbourne. His evidence was that Cellante did not tell Ms Brown it was not the owner of the property. There was no reason to say whether the company was registered or unregistered as the proprietor as it was selling her the property. The section 32 statement relative to Ms Brown’s terms contract of sale did not disclose the date that Cellante bought the property from Mr Taylor as it was not relevant to her as the purchaser and not legally required to be disclosed. All that had to be established was Cellante’s right to sell. He said he was the general manager of both Astvilla and Perna. </p>\r\n<p>96.&nbsp;Mr Cellante deposed that he tried to bring forward the settlement date so Ms Brown could go into the property earlier. Mr Taylor refused his requests. </p>\r\n<p>97.&nbsp;Mr Wissell gave evidence on behalf of Cellante. This evidence was confined to his employment by Vic Properties and the bare details of the discussions he had concerning the purchase of the property by Cellante from Mr Taylor. He was not taken in evidence in chief to the events of 17 June 2001, in particular to the events described in the evidence of Ms Brown. Therefore he did not contradict any of Ms Brown’s evidence. Mr Wissell was cross-examined very briefly by counsel for the Director. </p>\r\n<p>98.&nbsp;Robin Hocking gave valuation evidence on behalf of Cellante. He told the magistrate he was based in Melbourne. His main evidence was of the prices paid on vendor terms in six other Cellante sales. He deposed that, when those sales prices were considered, there was nothing unusual about the price paid by Ms Brown for Bowman Street. His evidence was the value of the property had to take into account whether vendor terms were available. Under cross-examination, he agreed all six of the Cellante purchasers came from suburban Melbourne and he did not know what information the purchasers had about local market property values. </p>\r\n<p>The findings of fact of the magistrate<br />99.&nbsp;The findings of fact of the magistrate have already been set out. </p>\r\n<p>100.&nbsp;In certain respects the findings of the magistrate are indefensible because they are patently not supported by the evidence. The critical question, however, is whether the mistaken findings concerned matters of significance such that the magistrate’s ultimate decision was made in error of law. </p>\r\n<p>101.&nbsp;There are relatively insignificant mistaken findings I can put to one side. For example, contrary to paragraphs 7 and 15 of the reasons for decision, the evidence did not establish Ms Brown accessed the Cellante website. The magistrate probably got this information from paragraph 10 of the particulars of claim, which were not proven. Although unfortunate, nothing turns on this mistake. </p>\r\n<p>102.&nbsp;Of more significance is the attack made by counsel for Cellante on the finding of the magistrate that Mr Cellante told Ms Brown that "she had done well...[it] was a good price and the house was in good condition" (paragraph 37 or the reasons for decision) and that the house was "a good buy" (paragraph 117). There was no evidence to support findings in exactly these terms. The magistrate may have picked up this language from the particulars of claim and the Director’s submissions. Ms Brown’s evidence was that Mr Cellante "congratulated me, told me what a wonderful house I’d got, that it was a good house" and told her she’d "done well." </p>\r\n<p>103.&nbsp;These findings of the magistrate were on a subject of significance. Mr Cellante was an individual defendant and the general manager of Astvilla and Perna. Mr Cellante’s alleged misrepresentations in relation to the price of the house, in particular, were central to the Director’s case against both Mr Cellante and the companies. The evidence in relation to this subject deserved careful consideration. Such a consideration would have revealed the findings could not have been made in the terms adopted. <br />104.&nbsp;While the magistrate was mistaken to make findings that Mr Cellante made representations in precisely the language attributed to him, I do not think this means his decision was made in error of law. On this aspect of the case, the decision, as it concerned all three defendants, was based, to a significant degree, on the finding that Mr Cellante misrepresented the house to be a good buy at the price, that is, to be reasonable in price. There was evidence to support such a finding. In the context in which Mr Cellante was speaking, to congratulate Ms Brown on her purchase, to tell her it was a wonderful house and a good house, and to tell her she had done well, was capable of carrying the implicit representation that the house was a good buy at the price, that is, reasonably priced. </p>\r\n<p>105.&nbsp;This brings me to the related and equally important attack of counsel for Cellante on the finding of the magistrate that the companies, as well as Mr Cellante, had misrepresented the price to be fair and reasonable (paragraphs 116 -122 of the reasons for decision). This is an important point. If the magistrate erred in law in concluding that this misrepresentation had been made, the case against Cellante was much weaker, if not destroyed. </p>\r\n<p>106.&nbsp;Counsel began his submission on this subject by pointing to paragraphs 19(d) and (h) of the particulars of claim. These alleged Mr Wissell advised Ms Brown on 17 June 2001 that "he could immediately sell the property five times over at the price" and "the price of the property was fair and reasonable" respectively. Cellante submitted these representations were not proved and none of the evidence supported a finding that the house was represented to be reasonably priced. </p>\r\n<p>107.&nbsp;Ms Brown’s uncontested evidence was Mr Wissell told her the "house was a very popular house and that he could sell that house no problems at all. He actually said that he could sell the house five times over." She left out "at the price." </p>\r\n<p>108.&nbsp;I think it was legally open to infer from Mr Wissell’s words that the house could be sold "no problems at all ... fives times over" that he was representing it could be so sold at the price Ms Brown was being offered it. The magistrate was entitled to treat this not as real estate puffery (paragraph 118 of the reasons for decision) but as a false representation as to price. We have seen Mr Cellante used similar language – Ms Brown deserved to be "congratulated"; it was a "wonderful house" she’d got; she’d "done well." This was also supportive of such an inference. </p>\r\n<p>109.&nbsp;Some other of the magistrate’s findings could only be justified as reasonable interferences, and a number of these were quite important. For example, his Honour found Cellante misrepresented the property to be in demand, so Ms Brown had to buy it immediately or lose it (paragraphs 94 and 97). He found Cellante misrepresented itself to be the owner of the property (paragraphs 93-94, 98 and 115). And he found Cellante used the Dimboola property to entice Ms Brown to Horsham, when it was not available, then showed her other properties, which were unsuitable. </p>\r\n<p>110.&nbsp;All of these inferences were open on the evidence. Given the uncontested nature of the evidence of Ms Brown, and, indeed, that of the true owner of the property, Mr Taylor, I find it hard to see how the magistrate could have avoided drawing these inferences. </p>\r\n<p>111.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted Cellante had an equitable interest in the property arising out of the verbal agreement to buy it from Mr Taylor. Whether or not this is correct, there was no error of law in the magistrate finding that Cellante lacked the capacity to sell with the property as its owner, which is the capacity it misrepresented it had. </p>\r\n<p>112.&nbsp;In relation to the magistrate’s findings concerning the value of the property, Cellante contended it was not open on the evidence to find a value of $25,600.00, being the amount for which the property was sold by Mr Taylor to Perna. </p>\r\n<p>113.&nbsp;The value of the property was a matter of fact for the magistrate to find. He had the evidence of Mr Wilson – the valuer with local experience who based his valuation on local sales on ordinary terms – and Mr Hocking – the valuer from Melbourne who based his valuation on six other Cellante sales on vendor terms. It was for the magistrate to evaluate this evidence. Paragraph 101 of his reasons for decision shows he did so. His Honour was entitled to act upon the basis of Mr Wilson’s evidence. He was not legally bound to accept Mr Hocking’s evidence. </p>\r\n<p>114.&nbsp;As I have already said, the findings on which the decision of the magistrate depended were, in summary, that Cellante misrepresented itself to be the owner of the property, that it knew Ms Brown to be inexperienced, that it misrepresented the property to be reasonably priced and that it misrepresented the property to be in high demand so, if Ms Brown wanted it, she would have to buy it immediately. These findings were open on the evidence. <br />115.&nbsp;The ground of appeal that the findings were not open on the evidence must be rejected.</p>\r\n<p>DID THE MAGISTRATE MISCONSTRUE THE FAIR TRADING ACT?<br />116.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted the magistrate erred in law in finding Astvilla, Perna and Mr Cellante had contravened s7(1) of the Fair Trading Act by engaging in unconscionable conduct. It was submitted his Honour’s findings were not open on the evidence and must have been based on a misconstruction of the meaning of "unconscionable conduct" in s7(1). He likewise submitted the findings of the magistrate of misleading or deceptive conduct must have been based on a misconstruction of s9(1). </p>\r\n<p>117.&nbsp;It is clear from the decision of the High Court of Australia in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v C G Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited[17] that to make a finding of unconscionable conduct under s7(1), the magistrate had to be satisfied that Ms Brown was at a special disadvantage in her dealings with Cellante, which seriously affected her ability to make a judgement in her own interests, and of which Cellante took unconscientious advantage. Inequality of bargaining power would not of itself be enough,[18] and the findings had to be made in respect of the companies and Mr Cellante individually. </p>\r\n<p>118.&nbsp;The magistrate specifically addressed the question whether Ms Brown was under a special disability or disadvantage (see paragraph 126 of the reasons of decision, which you will find above). He had listed Ms Brown’s personal circumstances in paragraph 86 (also above). His Honour said these circumstances were not contested, which, in the appeal before me, counsel for Cellante disputed. And he submitted the real question concerned what the companies and Mr Cellante knew when they engaged in the alleged unconscionable conduct. </p>\r\n<p>119.&nbsp;I think it was open on the evidence to justify a finding that the companies and Mr Cellante knew the matters listed in paragraph 86. But it is clear beyond argument that they knew Ms Brown was a single mother with young children, was receiving the sole parent’s pension, was a renter, was buying a house for the first time and was looking for a cheap house in the country which she could only afford on vendor terms. These facts showed for themselves that, as against Cellante, Ms Brown was in a position of special disadvantage. The magistrate found it took unconscientious advantage of Ms Brown by creating an atmosphere that kept her in a state of ignorance and inexperience, which involved a finding that Cellante knew she was in a position of special disadvantage (see paragraphs 126 and 128 of the reasons for decision). His Honour’s findings of fact in this regard are legally unimpeachable. </p>\r\n<p>120.&nbsp;His Honour’s understanding of the legal meaning of "unconscionable conduct" in s7(1) may be inferred from his citation of a passage in the judgement of Dodds-Streeton J in National Australia Bank v Walter.[19] With respect, I endorse the passage as a correct statement of the law. There is no material difference between the law as stated in ACCC v Berbatis and NAB v Walter. The magistrate relied upon the correct legal principles and did not misconstrue "unconscionable conduct" in s7(1). </p>\r\n<p>121.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted the magistrate had incorrectly rolled-up the misleading and deceptive conduct case and the unconscionable conduct case, which led him to fail to identify the conduct that was said to be unconscionable. </p>\r\n<p>122.&nbsp;His Honour’s reasons for decision show he appreciated the unconscionable conduct case required satisfaction of additional elements. This is why he cited NAB v Walter and addressed those elements. <br />123.&nbsp;On the facts found by the magistrate, there was an obvious connection between the misleading or deceptive conduct case and the unconscionable conduct case. His Honour found the companies and Mr Cellante had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s. 9(1). Cellante has not established that the magistrate misconstrued this provision or otherwise erred in law in his approach to this question. But, on same facts, the Director also put forward a case of unconscionable conduct under s7(1). So the magistrate went on to consider whether, by engaging in the same conduct, the companies and Mr Cellante had taken unconscientious advantage of Ms Brown, knowing her position of special disadvantage. He found that they had. His Honour did not err in law in adopting this approach. </p>\r\n<p>124.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante made a particular submission on behalf of Mr Cellante. He submitted the magistrate did not appreciate he had to make findings on the evidence in respect of the liability of each of the companies and Mr Cellante separately, and he did not do so as regards Mr Cellante. That the magistrate did have to deal with the cases separately is undoubtedly correct. But the reasons for decision show he did consider Mr Cellante’s personal liability separately (see for example paragraphs 109 and 112-115). </p>\r\n<p>125.&nbsp;The magistrate did not misconstrue, or adopt an approach that involved the misconstruction of, ss7(1) or 9(1) or the Fair Trading Act. This ground of appeal is rejected.</p>\r\n<p>SHOULD ORDERS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST MR CELLANTE?<br />The issues<br />126.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante submitted orders should not have been made against Mr Cellante. He submitted, first, the case had been put under s143(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1999, and this section did not allow orders to be made against an officer of a company in proceedings that were not for an offence against the Act. And, second, he submitted an employee, especially not an employee like Mr Cellante, who was the embodiment of the company, could not be found directly liable under ss7(1) or 9(1) for contravening conduct engaged in on behalf of the company. </p>\r\n<p>127.&nbsp;The further amended complaint did not make clear whether the Director put his case against Mr Cellante upon the basis that he was liable as a deemed contravener under s143(1) or upon the additional or alternative basis that he was directly liable for his own contravening conduct under ss7(1) and 9(1). Counsel for Cellante raised this at the end of the opening of counsel for the Director, who clarified the position. This is what counsel for the Director said:<br />"Sir, if I might take you to s9 of the Fair Trading Act, misleading and deceptive conduct. Now, what the plaintiff says sir, is that a person, Mr Cellante, must not in trade or commerce – he is an officer of Astvilla and Perna – and it is their trade or their commerce and it is engaged in conduct that is misleading or is likely to mislead or deceive. <br />If you then look at s143, and if a contravention has taken place of s9, he as an officer of the body corporate is deemed to have contravened the same provision. If he knowingly authorised or permitted that contravention."</p>\r\n<p>There was then an exchange between counsel for the Director and the magistrate, the result of which was that the magistrate confirmed his understanding that the Director was relying on ss7, 9 and 143. The Director then proceeded with his first witness. </p>\r\n<p>128.&nbsp;The remarks of counsel for the Director made clear he was putting the case against Mr Cellante on the basis he was liable as a deemed contravener under s143(1) and also upon the basis he was directly liable under ss7(1) or 9(1). The closing submissions of the Director put the case against Mr Cellante on both of these bases. The closing submissions made on behalf of the Cellante companies and Mr Cellante answered the submissions on both of these bases. </p>\r\n<p>129.&nbsp;I therefore conclude the liability of Mr Cellante as a deemed contravener under s143(1), and further or alternatively as a direct contravener under ss7(1) or 9(1), was an issue before the magistrate. </p>\r\n<p>130.&nbsp;The magistrate made orders against Mr Cellante, but did not specifically mention s143(1). Before this Court, counsel for the Director submitted his Honour’s orders were supported by s143(1). This may be so, but the magistrate also mentioned a New South Wales case in which an employee was held directly liable under the fair trading legislation of that State.[20] I therefore invited the parties to make further submissions in relation to both alternative bases for the liability of Mr Cellante. </p>\r\n<p>131.&nbsp;It was conceded by counsel for Mr Cellante that he was an officer of Astvilla and Perna for the purposes s143(1).</p>\r\n<p>Liability of officers of corporations under the Fair Trading Act<br />132.&nbsp;This is s143 of the Fair Trading Act:[21] <br />"143 Offences by bodies corporate<br />(1) If a body corporate contravenes any provision of this Act, each officer of the body corporate is deemed to have contravened the same provision if the officer knowingly authorised or permitted the contravention.<br />(2) A person may be proceeded against and convicted under a provision in accordance with sub-section (1) whether or not the body corporate has been proceeded against under that provision.<br />(3) Nothing in this section affects any liability imposed on a body corporate for an offence committed by the body corporate against this Act."</p>\r\n<p>133.&nbsp;Counsel for the Director submitted s143(1) deemed Mr Cellante to have contravened the Act. This brought him within the scope of s149(1) (relating to injunctions) and s158(3) (relating to compensation). This submission was based upon the generality of the language in s143(1). By this language, an officer who knowingly authorised or permitted a corporation to contravene the Act is simply deemed to have contravened the Act personally. Counsel for the Director submitted s143(1) did not itself qualify the kinds of proceedings to which this deeming applied and no qualification could be otherwise discerned. </p>\r\n<p>134.&nbsp;The meaning of a provision is to be ascertained, in the first instance and not just to resolve any ambiguity, from its immediate context and the context of the statute as a whole,[22] including its objects.[23] It would therefore be wrong to take s143(1) out of this context and then try to interpret it on its own, which is what the submissions of counsel for the Director invite me to do. </p>\r\n<p>135.&nbsp;Section 143 came in with the Fair Trading Act when it was originally enacted in 1999. It has not been amended since, although many other provisions have been. The natural context of s143(1) is the Act in its pre-amended 1999 form. I think the later amendments to other provisions were not intended to alter the original meaning of s143(1). </p>\r\n<p>136.&nbsp;When enacted in 1999, s143 formed part of Division 1 of Part 11, as it still does. The Part 11 heading was: "Enforcement and remedies." The Division 1 heading was: "General enforcement provisions." Division 1 contained s142 ("prosecutions of offences"), s143 ("offences by bodies corporate"), s144 ("imputing state of mind to bodies corporate") and s145 ("liability of body corporate or employer for acts of others"). Putting aside the controversy about s143(1), all of these provisions related to proceedings for an offence against the Act. This context supplies a strong pointer that the whole of Division 1, including s143(1), was intended to relate only to proceedings of this kind. </p>\r\n<p>137.&nbsp;The Act contemplated the bringing of proceedings of several different kinds. At the greatest level of generality, s144(3), for example, referred to "any proceedings under the Act." Therefore, when the drafters wanted a provision to apply to any proceeding, they used general words of this kind. Next, s158(3) referred to proceedings under s149 (for an injunction), s150 (for an interim injunction) and s159 (for damages). Section 155(8) contained no less than four separately specified kinds of proceedings. Therefore, when the drafters wanted a provision to apply to a particular kind, or several particular kinds, of proceedings, they used appropriate words to give effect to this intention. Finally, s158(1), as well as many other provisions, including those in Division 1 of Part 11, referred to proceedings for an offence against the Act. Therefore, when the drafters wanted to limit the application of a provision to a proceeding of this kind, they did so, as they did in the provisions of Division 1, with the single exception of s143(1). Overall the drafting pattern is clear: particular provisions applied to particular proceedings and not others, or to any proceedings, depending upon the words used to describe the proceeding concerned. </p>\r\n<p>138.&nbsp;In its original form, Part 11 of the Fair Trading Act 1999 did not contain accessorial provisions of the kind now found in s145. Section 31 of the Fair Trading Act 1985 did, but they were left out of the 1999 Act. The 1985 Act did not contain a provision like s143. I have considered whether the new s143(1) was intended to take the place of the previous s31. But s143(1) is self-evidently not a "person involved" provision in the terms commonly found in trade practices legislation, while s31 was. Section 143(1) is expressed in terms of a deeming provision. It is much narrower in scope than a civil accessorial provision, like the earlier s31 and the later s. 145. I cannot accept that the legislature, when it left out s31 and brought in s143(1), intended thereby significantly to reduce the scope of accessorial liability in civil cases. The differences in the terms and the context of the two provisions, and the later introduction of s145 to fill the gap left in the 1999 Act, preclude me from interpreting s143(1) as even a partial replacement for s31 in civil cases. </p>\r\n<p>139.&nbsp;When s145 was introduced in 2003,[24] s143 was not touched. On the interpretation of the counsel for the Director, s143(1) is a deeming provision capable of applying to civil as well as to criminal proceedings. If this is right, in its operation in civil cases, s143(1) previously covered, and must therefore still cover, some of the ground now covered by s145. So interpreted, the two provisions could conceivably sit side by side - s143(1) applying to the civil liability of officers of corporations and s145 applying to the civil liability of accessories generally. However, such a construction seems highly artificial. It is far more likely that s145 was brought in because the 1999 Act in its original form omitted to make provision for accessorial liability in civil cases, in s143(1) or otherwise. </p>\r\n<p>140.&nbsp;Under the Fair Trading Act 1999, until s145 was introduced in 2003, a civil action could not be brought against an accessory as there was no "person involved" provision. The Director would say there must be an exception to this general proposition - civil liability could be brought home to an officer of a corporation through s143(1). On this construction, officers of corporations formed part of a category of their own. This is an extremely unlikely construction. The more likely one is that the legislature simply failed to make provision for civil accessorial liability at all, which it corrected in 2003. </p>\r\n<p>141.&nbsp;Each of ss142, 144 and 145(1) and (2) specifies the proceeding to which the provision relates as a prosecution for an offence against the Act. Sections 143(2) and (3) use slightly different language, namely that a person may be "proceeded against and convicted" under s143(1). Unmistakeably, this too is a reference to a proceeding for an offence against the Act. Section 143(2) assumes that s143(1) applies to a proceeding of this kind, as does s143(3). It is true that neither of these provisions expressly states s143(1) applies only to a proceeding of this kind. But the immediate context supplied by the provisions of Division 1 and the general context supplied by the Act as whole shows this was the statutory intention. </p>\r\n<p>142.&nbsp;The objects of the Fair Trading Act 1999 mainly are "(a) to promote and encourage fair trading practices and a competitive and fair market; (aa) to protect consumers; [and] (b) to regulate trade practices..."[25] These objects are promoted by construing s143(1) so as to bring about deemed contravention, in the circumstances specified, for officers of companies in civil cases. They are not promoted by construing the provision so as not to apply to such officers in civil cases. Therefore, the former construction is to be preferred.[26] However, for the reasons I have given, I think this construction is not open. </p>\r\n<p>143.&nbsp;In my view, properly interpreted, s143(1) applies only to a proceeding for an offence against the Act. Since the proceeding brought by the Director was not a proceeding of that kind, the magistrate’s orders against Mr Cellante could not be supported under s143(1).</p>\r\n<p>Direct liability of employees under the Fair Trading Act<br />144.&nbsp;Whether or not the magistrate also acted under s143(1) of the Fair Trading Act, it is clear from his reasons for decision that he considered Mr Cellante was directly liable for misleading or deceptive or unconscionable conduct engaged in by him as an employee on behalf of Astvilla and Perna. He applied the requirement that the employee must not have acted merely as a conduit[27] and made all the findings necessary for Mr Cellante to be directly liable. </p>\r\n<p>145.&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to decide whether, under ss7(1) or 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act, an employee can be directly liable for misleading or deceptive conduct, or unconscionable, conduct engaged in for an employer. </p>\r\n<p>146.&nbsp;In some cases the issue is whether, in the criminal law context, the contravening conduct of an employee can be attributed to a company for the purposes of shooting home liability to the company. I have recently dealt with this issue in another legislative context.[28] I there decided it was a question of construction whether the company could be so liable, and the policy of the legislation was an important consideration. The present case raises the opposite issue – the employee contends, in the civil law context, he cannot be found liable for his own contravening conduct because the company alone is so liable. I think the answer to this issue also lies in the proper construction of the legislation, taking its policy into account. </p>\r\n<p>147.&nbsp;Sections 7(1) and 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act simply state that "a person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in" the proscribed conduct. A "person" here means a corporation and an individual.[29] The generality of the language strongly suggests the prohibitions were intended to apply to the conduct of any person, without qualification. Therefore, speaking generally, a person, in whatever capacity, in trade or commerce, engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or unconscionable, is exposed to direct liability for the contravention.[30] The natural and ordinary meaning of the language is amply wide enough to support such a construction. </p>\r\n<p>148.&nbsp;It has been said of s52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and it may equally be said of ss7(1) and 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1999 (Vic), that "the nature of the prohibition imposed ...is ...governed by the terms in which it is created and the context in which it is found."[31] There is nothing in the terms of ss7(1) or 9(1) or in the context of the Fair Trading Act to warrant a narrow construction. To confine the operation of the provisions to non-employees, I would have to read down the word "person" to exclude employees and read in a requirement that the trade or commerce be that of the person themselves. Such a construction, quite apart from being contrary to high authority, as I will later show, would not promote the objects of the Act, the main ones of which I have already mentioned. A construction that gives effect to the generality of the language in ss7(1) and 9(1) does promote these objects and is to be preferred. As has also been said of s52(1) of the Trade Practices Act, the "generality of the language" of the provisions "must be afforded full weight within the framework" of the policy of the legislation.[32] The reasons that compelled me to adopt a narrow construction s143(1) may be starkly compared with the paucity of reasons for narrowly construing ss7(1) and 9(1). </p>\r\n<p>149.&nbsp;As we have seen, Division 1 of Part 11 contains provisions for the enforcement of the Fair Trading Act against corporations and, under s143(1) and (2), officers who knowingly authorise or permit contravening conduct by corporations. The operation of these provisions is in no way affected if employees of corporations are directly liable for misleading or deceptive or unconscionable conduct of their own in their employer’s trade or commerce. As an employee, the person is an "officer."[33] If they knowingly authorise or permit the contravention, they are liable to prosecution for an offence under s143(2). If they engage in the contravening conduct, they are directly liable, both to prosecution and civil action. The criminal or civil liability of the corporation is not affected. </p>\r\n<p>150.&nbsp;In s145 of the Fair Trading Act 1999 as originally enacted[34] there were positive indications that employees could be directly liable. In summary, s145 made the conduct of an agent or employee, within the scope of their actual or apparent authority, "also" the conduct of their employer.[35] The provisions operated so that, where an agent or employee of another person or company engaged in conduct within the scope of their actual or apparent authority, the conduct was deemed "also" to have been engaged in by the other person or company. The assumption behind these provisions was that the conduct was substantively that of the agent or employee. I think ss7(1) and 9(1) operate on the same basis. </p>\r\n<p>151.&nbsp;We know that, by the Fair Trading (Amendment) Act 2003, s145 was substituted with a "person involved" provision in familiar terms. It makes aiders and abetters and other specified persons liable for the conduct of the primary contravener.[36] We also know such a provision, until 2003, was absent from the Fair Trading Act 1999. It was therefore missing at the time the events at issue in the present case occurred. Therefore, it cannot be argued in this case that there is an inconsistency between an employee being both directly liable under ss7(1) or 9(1) and liable as an accessory under an accessorial provision like the current s145.[37] </p>\r\n<p>152.&nbsp;If I thought this temporary lack of an accessorial provision affected the analysis, I would review my overall conclusion. I do not think it does, for the following reasons. </p>\r\n<p>153.&nbsp;We have seen that the Fair Trading Act 1985 in its original form contained, in s31, a provision like the current s145. It seems to have been left out of the 1999 Act by mistake. In relation to the substantive liability of employees, the Parliament would not have intended the 1985 Act and the Act as amended in 2003 Act to operate differently to the pre-amended 1999 Act. And if we examine the direct liability of employees under s11(1)[38] of the 1985 Act and ss7(1) and 9(1) of the Act as amended in 2003, we see such direct liability does not detract from the operation of s31 of the former or s145 of the latter. Under the 1985 Act and the Act as amended in 2003, an employee, acting as something more than a mere conduit, might be directly liable for misleading or deceptive or unconscionable conduct in their employer’s trade or commerce because the contravening conduct was their own; alternatively the employee might the liable as an accessory because they were an intentional[39] participant in contravening conduct of their employer. By contrast, under the pre-amended 1999 Act, which lacked the accessorial provision, the employee could only be directly liable. For these reasons, I think direct liability of employees was a feature of the legislation from the start, and still is. </p>\r\n<p>154.&nbsp;For these reasons, treating the issue as one of pure statutory construction, I would conclude employees can be directly liable for conduct of their own, done in the course of their employer’s trade or commerce, which contravenes ss7(1) or 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act. </p>\r\n<p>155.&nbsp;Let me now turn now to the decided cases. </p>\r\n<p>156.&nbsp;Prior judicial consideration of this issue may be grouped into three categories – decisions concerning estate agents, company directors and employees. </p>\r\n<p>157.&nbsp;The Full Court of the Federal Court held an estate agent directly liable in John G Glass Real Estate Pty Limited v Karawi Constructions Pty Limited.[40] This was a misleading and deceptive conduct case under s52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The agent engaged in conduct beyond "merely passing on information."[41] However the Full Court saw the agent’s conduct as an ordinary part of the business of an estate agent, not part of the business of its principal. The case is therefore not an exact analogy with the present, where the employee – Mr Cellante – was acting in his employer’s business. In Pricom Pty Ltd v Sgarioto[42] Eames J (as he then was) decided an estate agent who had contravened s11(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1985 (Vic) was directly liable. But again, the basis of the decision was that the estate agent, a company, was engaged, through its employee, in "its own trade and commerce."[43] </p>\r\n<p>158.&nbsp;The position of a company director is more closely analogous to that of an employee. There have been several cases in which directors have been held liable, not as accessories to their company’s conduct, but directly for their own conduct. </p>\r\n<p>159.&nbsp;Lauriana Pty Ltd v Corfield Food Warehouse Pty Ltd[44] arose under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (WA). The directors made false and misleading statements on behalf of their company. The company was found liable under s52 of the Trade Practices Act. The directors were found liable, both as aiders and abetters under that Act and as direct contraveners under s10 of the Fair Trading Act. The directors were not engaged in an independent business; they were engaged in trade or commerce on their company’s behalf, like an employee. </p>\r\n<p>160.&nbsp; Another Western Australian case, but in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, is Arktos Pty Ltd v Idyllic Nominees Pty Ltd.[45] One question was whether a director was directly liable under s10. The answer given by Carr, Tamberlin and RD Nicholson JJ could not have been clearer:<br />"[A] director of a corporation who acts on its behalf in the course of trade or commerce also acts himself or herself in trade or commerce and, if the corporation is liable under a State Fair Trading Act for their conduct, they also attract primary liability under the same statute..."[46]</p>\r\n<p>161.&nbsp;The director was held directly liable in Nescor Industries Group Pty Ltd v Miba Pty Ltd,[47] which concerned the Victorian legislation. The trial judge found[48] that, acting on behalf of the company, the director misled the buyer of the company’s franchise. He was not a mere passer-on.[49] Again, the company was held liable under s52 of the Trade Practices Act and the director was held liable under the State legislation, this time s11(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1985. The appeal to the Full Court failed. Davies J (Tamberlin and RD Nicholson JJ agreeing) saw a director as a species of agent (as is, I would add, an employee):<br />"Agents may be held to be in breach of the statutory provision because they are directly responsible for the misleading information or because the fact that the information has come from them has added something to its weight and authority."[50]</p>\r\n<p>162.&nbsp;Cleary v Australian Co-Operative Foods Ltd[51] was decided under the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). The directors, acting on behalf of the company, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. Under the NSW legislation, the conduct of the directors was deemed to be that of their company. Austin J found them to be directly liable. Therefore it was not necessary to consider the question of their liability as accessories.[5] </p>\r\n<p>163.&nbsp;I can now turn to cases involving employees, of which there are three. </p>\r\n<p>164.&nbsp;The first is Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McCaskey.[53] Here French J made orders by consent against an employee and her employer company in relation to contravening conduct in which she engaged on its behalf. This is an unusual federal case. As the conduct involved the use of telephonic services, the prohibitions in the Trade Practices Act 1974 applied both to the employee as an individual and to the employer as a company. The legislative context is therefore analogous to the prohibitions in the Fair Trading Act. Before making the orders, French J satisfied himself they were called for. The orders against the employee could only be justified if her conduct gave rise to concurrent liability for her and her employer. </p>\r\n<p>165.&nbsp;The second is Daniel Wong v Citibank Ltd,[54] a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. The defendant, like Mr Cellante, was employed as the general manager of a company. She engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct on behalf of her employer. The company was sued under s52 of the Trade Practices Act and she was sued under s42 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). The trial judge reviewed the authorities, found she was not a mere conduit and held that she, as an employee, and the company, as her employer, were liable under the state and federal legislation respectively. As to her liability under the state legislation, Hamilton J said this;<br />"The FTA proscribes conduct by natural persons. If that conduct is in trade or commerce and cannot be said not to be misleading conduct of the person who engages in it by reason that that person is acting merely as a conduit, in my view the person is not removed from the purview of the Act by the fact he engages in the conduct as the employee of another."[55]</p>\r\n<p>166.&nbsp;Dismissing the appeal, Beazley JA (Sheller and Bryson JJA agreeing) said:<br />"As a matter of law, an employee acts as agent for the employer. There is no basis in principle why different rules should apply to agents who are appointed in different circumstances. Provided that a party alleging the contravention is able to establish that the agent is liable within the principles stated in Yorke v Lucas, then liability under the section attaches, notwithstanding that the agent in question is an employee acting within authority in the course of employment."[56]</p>\r\n<p>167.&nbsp;The third is Arms v Houghton,[57] a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia concerning the Fair Trading Act 1999 (Vic) in its pre-amended form, the very form applicable in the present case. The trial judge decided the employee defendants could not be directly liable for misleading and deceptive conduct in which they engaged on their employer’s behalf. The appeal was upheld. Nicholson, Mansfield and Bennett JJ reviewed the authorities, most of which I have dealt with here, and firmly concluded that employees could be directly liable:<br />"The acceptance of the principle of possible employee liability in the circumstances considered in these reasons has not yet been considered by the High Court. If there are reasons upon which to distinguish the position of an employee in that respect from a director, they have not been articulated either by the Full Court in Arktos, the Court of Appeal in Wong or in argument before this Court... <br />Furthermore, if there were some foundation in principle it would not appear to be likely to be germane in the context of s9 of the FTA 1999. That provision is to be understood in the context of its enacted objectives as explained by the Minister and in the absence from that Act of any provision for accessorial liability which might arguably be utilised to provide a foundation for argument that the statute should be otherwise construed." [58]<br />168.&nbsp;These decisions strongly support the construction of the Fair Trading Act I prefer. </p>\r\n<p>169.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Cellante invites me to distinguish or not follow these decisions. He submits Mr Cellante cannot be found directly liable under ss7(1) and 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1999 because, to pick up the words of Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass,[59] he was the "embodiment of the company." It was submitted that Mr Cellante "so dominated the business and affairs...[of Astvilla and Perna] ... that his conduct was the conduct of each of the companies."[60] </p>\r\n<p>170.&nbsp;The logic of the analysis in the above decisions does not support the drawing of a distinction between one kind of agent, director or employee and another. To take employees as an example, they have been found to be liable where, within the scope of their authority, acting as more than a mere conduit and in their employer’s trade or commerce, they have engaged in contravening conduct. This principle of liability comes from the provisions of the state and federal legislation, which are in relevantly common terms, and is applicable to all such employees, including employees who embody the company. </p>\r\n<p>171.&nbsp;I mentioned the terms of the legislation. Sections 7(1) and 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act, for example, prohibit a person from engaging in the proscribed conduct "in trade or commerce." One necessary basis of the decisions on the direct liability of employees, and many decisions in analogous situations, is that the conduct said to be contravening can be "in" someone else’s trade or commerce. This basis is well established.[61] </p>\r\n<p>172.&nbsp;Counsel for Mr Cellante relies upon the decision of the High Court in Hamilton v Whitehead (1988) 166 CLR 121. This case is distinguishable. It concerned the question whether a managing director could be held liable as an accessory under companies and securities legislation for contravening conduct of his own which the legislation treated as the direct conduct of the company as a principal. It did not concern, and the result in the case does not demand a particular answer to, the different question whether an employee and an employer can both be liable under trade practices or fair trading legislation for contravening conduct of the employee. I also point out the legislation in Hamilton v Whitehead contained no analogue to the particular words in ss7(1) and 9(1) that make a person potentially liable for contravening conduct "in" someone else’s trade or commerce. </p>\r\n<p>173.&nbsp;The state fair trading legislation gives effect to a cooperative state-federal scheme for the national regulation of trade and commerce in accordance with widely-accepted trade practices principles. It is highly desirable that the same answers be given to legal questions about important aspects of the operation of the legislation in different states, especially where the enactments are not in materially different terms. At least in relation to misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct the state fair trading legislation is uniform. Therefore I should apply the principle of interpretation governing the interpretation of uniform legislation. According to this principle, I, especially as a single judge, would not depart from the interpretation adopted by an Australian intermediate appellate court unless convinced that the interpretation was plainly wrong.[62] This principle applies to the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Wong v Citibank Limited[63] but with special force to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Arms v Houghton.[64] Although this decision is not binding, it is a unanimous decision of an intermediate appellate court concerning the Victorian legislation and directly on point. </p>\r\n<p>174.&nbsp;I do not consider the decisions reviewed above to be plainly wrong. I consider them to be correct. In particular, for the reasons given in my own analysis of the Fair Trading Act 1999, I consider that, with respect, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia correctly decided Arms v Houghton. </p>\r\n<p>175.&nbsp;I therefore conclude the magistrate correctly decided Mr Cellante, as the employed general manager of the companies, could be found directly liable under ss7(1) and 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1999 for the misleading or deceptive conduct, and unconscionable conduct, in which he engaged on their behalf.</p>\r\n<p>THE RESTRAINING ORDER<br />The restraining order was supported by valid findings of fact<br />176.&nbsp;The magistrate made an order against Cellante restraining the companies and Mr Cellante from "making representations in trade or commerce that they are the owners of properties when they are not in fact the owners." </p>\r\n<p>177.&nbsp;Counsel for Cellante attacked the restraining order on the same three grounds upon which he attacked the decision of the magistrate generally, namely that the findings went beyond the particulars, the findings went beyond the evidence and the findings involved the misinterpretation of ss7 and 9 of the Fair Trading Act. As the attack upon the findings of the magistrate on each of these three grounds has been rejected, the attack upon the restraining order on these grounds must also be rejected.<br />The restraining order was not too wide<br />178.&nbsp;On the invitation of the Court the parties made submissions on whether the terms of the restraining order were too wide. Counsel for Cellante submitted that the terms were too wide. <br />179.&nbsp;If the order purported to restrain Cellante from selling properties that it did not own at the time of sale, there would be a strong argument that it was too wide. The provisions of Parts I and II of the Sale of Land Act[65] permit a person who satisfies the statutory requirements to sell under a terms contract land that the person does not "own." It would be wrong to restrain a person from doing what he or she may lawfully do. However, this is not what the restraining order made by the magistrate does. </p>\r\n<p>180.&nbsp;The order restrains Cellante from selling properties by representing that it is the owner of the properties when it is not. The terms of the order arise directly out of the findings of the magistrate about the nature of the misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct that Cellante engaged in. These findings are set out in paragraphs 111 - 115 of the magistrate’s reasons for decision (see above). </p>\r\n<p>181.&nbsp;As these findings reveal, the magistrate considered it was central to the contravening nature of the conduct that Cellante had misrepresented to Ms Brown that it was the owner of the property. It was this misrepresentation that enabled Cellante to create an atmosphere of urgency and pressure. Unless Ms Brown was made to believe that Cellante, because it owned the property, could, virtually overnight, sell it to somebody else, she could not be induced to buy it herself on the first visit. If she knew the property did not belong to Cellante, and Cellante had no more than an oral agreement to buy it, she would have been put seriously on her guard. </p>\r\n<p>182.&nbsp;It made sense, therefore, to cast the order in the terms that the magistrate adopted. The order clearly and unequivocally restrains Cellante from engaging in the conduct found to be contravening, as required by s149 of the Fair Trading Act. The order does not restrain Cellante from engaging in lawful trading activity. Cellante can continue to sell property under terms contracts in compliance with the provisions of the Sale of Land Act. But, if it does so by representing that it owns property when it does not, it will be in breach of the order of the magistrate. Therefore, the terms of the restraining order were not too wide. </p>\r\n<p>CONCLUSION<br />183.&nbsp;The Director of Consumer Affairs brought a test case against the Cellante property organisation alleging that, when it sold a house to Kerrie Brown, it engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct in contravention of ss7(1) and 9(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1999, </p>\r\n<p>184.&nbsp;The Director sought, from the Magistrates’ Court of Victoria, an order for damages for Ms Brown and an order restraining Cellante from selling properties in the same way in the future. </p>\r\n<p>185.&nbsp;The magistrate heard the evidence and found Ms Brown was a single mother with young children, was receiving the single parent’s pension, was living in a rented house in a suburb of Melbourne and wanted to buy a cheap house in the country on vendor terms. After contacting Cellante, Ms Brown drove to Horsham in north-western Victoria and met a Cellante salesperson. On that day, for $55,000.00, and for the first time in her life, she bought from Cellante a house in a nearby town - a house Cellante did not own, which it had agreed orally to buy only days earlier for $25,600.00 and which had been on the market for years. </p>\r\n<p>186.&nbsp;The magistrate found Cellante, on the pretext it owned the house, convinced Ms Brown, whom it knew to be inexperienced, to buy the house, at a price represented to be reasonable, which was false, and immediately, because the property was in high demand, which was also false. </p>\r\n<p>187.&nbsp;The magistrate upheld the Director’s case. His Honour found Cellante had engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct in the way it sold the house to Ms Brown. The Cellante companies, Astvilla Pty Ltd and Perna Pty Ltd, and their general manager, Livio Cellante, were ordered to pay her damages and interest. To protect other buyers in the future, they were also ordered not to make representations in trade or commerce that they are the owners of properties when in fact they are not owners. </p>\r\n<p>188.&nbsp;Cellante appealed to this Court on a question of law. It submitted the findings of the magistrate were not open on the pleadings or the evidence, the magistrate misconstrued the Fair Trading Act and no orders could or should have been made against Mr Cellante. </p>\r\n<p>189.&nbsp;I reject each of Cellante’s grounds of appeal and uphold the decision of the magistrate and the orders his Honour made. Cellante well knew the case the Director put against it. The magistrate made no legal errors in the way he conducted the hearing or dealt with the pleading issues. The findings that Astvilla, Perna and Mr Cellante had engaged in misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct were open on the evidence. The magistrate did not misconstrue the legislation and he properly applied the correct legal tests. </p>\r\n<p>190.&nbsp;Cellante has established that s143(1) of the Fair Trading Act did not allow the magistrate to make orders against Mr Cellante, being an officer of the Cellante companies, as a deemed contravener. This provision applies only to proceedings for an offence, whereas the proceedings brought by the Director were civil in nature. But the magistrate’s orders against Mr Cellante were still valid. He correctly decided the prohibitions in the Fair Trading Act against misleading or deceptive, and unconscionable, conduct applied directly to employees who, like Mr Cellante, had engaged in such conduct in their employer’s trade or commerce as something more than a mere conduit. </p>\r\n<p>191.&nbsp;The appeal is dismissed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] More precisely, on 22 June 2004 and 13 July 2004 the magistrate ordered Astvilla, Perna and Mr Cellante and each of them to pay Ms Brown damages in the amount of $29,984.00 and interest of $5,679.76 and damages in the amount of $1,600.00 and interest of $303.06, together with costs. This order appears in the order made by Master Kings in this Court on 11 August 2004. Counsel for the parties informed me this could be treated as an accurate source of the terms of the orders made by the magistrate. <br />[2] The order made was that Astvilla, Perna and Mr Cellante be restrained from "making representations in trade or commerce that they are owners of properties when they are not in fact the owner" (taken from the order of Master Kings). <br />[3] Dare v Pulham (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664; Leotta v Public Transport Commission (NSW) (1976) 9 ALR 437 at 446; Water Board v Moustakas (1988) 180 CLR 491 at 497; Mummery v Irvings Proprietary Limited (1956) 96 CLR 99 at 100; Douglas v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 126 at 133. <br />[4] At 133 (citations in the text omitted). <br />[5] (1997) 150 ALR 633.

C. was subject to an agreement which provided inter alia that all employment was casual. C. applied to a magistrate for an order that in accordance with the provsions of the Long Service Leave Act 1992 (Act) he be granted long service leave. The magistrate granted the application and in addition ordered that the MCC pay C.''s costs. As part of the case before the magistrate, reference was made to a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Industrial Appeals Court and Automatic Totalisators Ltd; Ex parte Kingston, unrep, 26 February 1976 whereby the Court held that "continuous employment" for the purposes of founding an entitlement to long service leave was performance of continuous employment with one employer pursuant to a continuing contract imposing mutual obligations to provide services and employment. The magistrate declined to apply the ratio of that case and made the order. Upon appeal— <br />HELD: Appeal allowed.<br />The broad ratio decidendi of Ex parte Kingston is that continuous employment within the terms of s56 of the Act requires a continuous contract imposing an obligation on the employer to offer, and on the employee to render, employment. The learned magistrate was bound to apply that ratio. His failure to do so constituted an error of law pursuant to s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act. In Ex parte Kingston the Full Court’s construction of “continuous employment” was clear, deliberate and fundamental to its reasoning. Successive legislation, including consolidations and amending statutes, has employed the same term substantially unaltered. It may be inferred that, until the terminology is changed, the construction propounded in Ex parte Kingston represents Parliament’s intention, and should be applied.<br />DODDS-STREETON J: <br />Introduction and Background<br />1.&nbsp;The appellant, Melbourne Cricket Club (“MCC”) appeals pursuant to s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989 from the order of Mr M. Smith, Magistrate, made 5&nbsp;July 2004[1], by which the learned magistrate ordered that the respondent, Mr Francis Clohesy, be granted long service leave in accordance with the Long Service Leave Act 1992 (Vic) (“the Act”) and that MCC pay Mr Clohesy’s costs. The appellant contends that the learned magistrate erred in failing to apply the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Industrial Appeals Court and Automatic Totalisators Limited; Ex parte Raymond John Kingston (“Ex parte Kingston”),[2] which bound him to construe s56 of the Act as conferring an entitlement to long service leave only if the employee had rendered service over a 15 year period under a continuous contract which imposed an obligation to do so. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;The Magistrates’ Court, by letter dated 11 August 2004, entered an appearance in the matter and advised that it did not intend to be represented at the hearing of the appeal. </p>\r\n<p>Relevant Facts<br />3.&nbsp;In the present case, the principal facts found by the magistrate are undisputed. </p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;MCC is a body corporate established pursuant to the Melbourne Cricket Club Act 1974 (Vic). It operates the Melbourne Cricket Ground where, on various occasions throughout the year, events are conducted. The events are usually sporting in nature, but also include concerts and other entertainments. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;In order to conduct the events, it is necessary for the MCC to have available a large number of staff who can be called upon to meet the anticipated requirements of the day. MCC currently has a `bank’ of approximately 800 ''casuals'' from which it draws its staffing needs. The casual employees are designated ''events personnel''. They carry out a number of different tasks, which fall into various categories. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;The terms and conditions established by two instruments (certified agreements) of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, made pursuant to the Work Place Relations Act in 1988 and 2001 apply to MCC’s engagement of all casual events personnel. The relevant certified agreements are:<br />&nbsp;<br />* the Entertainment and Broadcasting Industry (Recreation Grounds etc - Victoria) Award 2000; and <br />* the Melbourne Cricket Club Event Employees Certified Agreement 2001.</p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The industrial instruments set out various terms of employment, such as rates of pay and overtime. The certified agreements contain the following provision:<br />&nbsp;<br />TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT <br />7. All employment pursuant to the agreement is casual. No employee can be guaranteed any offer of employment beyond shifts offered to him or her as part of a periodic roster. However, employees will not be disadvantaged if their availability for the roster is limited due to parental obligations.</p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The 1988 certified agreement provides that “because of the casual nature of the employment no leave of any kind is due to employees.” That provision is not, however, included in the 2001 certified agreement. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The respondent, Mr Clohesy, began working with the MCC as an ''events person'' in about July 1984. Prior to 1995, staff such as Mr Clohesy would be advised of their next ''shift'' by way of a card presented to them at the end of their previous shift. From 1995, the MCC commenced a process whereby it would send out ''appointment sheets'' to casual employees, which requested them to indicate their availability on a seasonal basis. For example, prior to the 2004 football season, casuals in the ''bank'' were sent a form which required them to indicate alongside each game scheduled at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, their availability or otherwise. Following the return of the availability sheets, events personnel would then be sent an appointment card or would be contacted by telephone with details as to when they were required. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;Over the years since 1984, Mr Clohesy made himself available for all football matches, for concerts and for some of the cricket games, particularly test match and international games. The evidence indicates that Mr&nbsp;Clohesy was not offered the opportunity to work at, and did not make himself available for, a large number of games in the domestic cricket competition. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;Mr Clohesy was under no legally enforceable obligation to attend on any day which he had accepted for attendance. It was expected that, as a matter of courtesy, events personnel such as Mr&nbsp;Clohesy would notify the MCC, if for some reason, they were unable to attend. However, a person who did not attend was not penalized for failing to do so, save that a casual may have been allocated less work in the future if he or she became “notoriously unreliable.” </p>\r\n<p>Long Service Leave Act 1992 (Vic)<br />12.&nbsp;The Act provides for long service leave entitlements of certain employees. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;Section 1 of the Act provides:<br />&nbsp;<br />“1. Purpose The purpose of this Act is to make provision with respect to the long service leave entitlements of certain employees.”</p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;Section 56 of the Act provides:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Basic entitlement to long service leave <br />56. Basic entitlement to long service leave<br />An employee is entitled to—<br />(a) 13 weeks of long service leave on ordinary pay on completing 15 years of continuous employment with one employer; and <br />(b) 4 1/3 weeks of long service leave on ordinary pay on completing each period of 5 years of continuous employment with that employer after the first 15 years of continuous employment with that employer.”</p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Section 60 of the Act modifies the literal meaning of “one employer”, setting out “several situations in which an employee is to be regarded, for the purposes of this Division, as having been employed by the one employer, even though the employee may have worked over the relevant period of time for more than one employer in a strict legal sense.” Such situations include employment of a person by related corporations, and where there is a change of ownership of a business or a transfer of assets. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;Section 62 of the Act provides: <br />“Meaning of “continuous employment” <br />62. Meaning of “continuous employment”<br />(1) This section sets out several situations in which an employee is to be regarded, for the purposes of this Division, as having been continuously employed even though in a strict legal sense it could be said that the employee’s employment was interrupted. <br />(2) An employee’s employment is to be regarded as being continuous despite— <br />(a) the taking of any annual leave or long service leave; <br />(b) any absence from work on account of illness or injury; <br />(c) the taking of any other leave granted by his or her employer; <br />(d) any interruption or ending of the employment by the employer if the interruption or ending is made with the intention of avoiding obligations in respect of long service leave or annual leave; <br />(e) in the case of an employee performing duties in relation to assets of a particular kind, any absence from work arising solely because of a transfer to which section 60(6) applies of those assets from one employer to another employer; <br />(f) any interruption arising directly or indirectly from an industrial dispute; <br />(g) the dismissal of the employee, but only if he or she is re-employed within a period not exceeding 3 months after his or her dismissal; <br />(h) the standing-down of the employee on account of slackness of trade; <br />(i) if the employee is a woman, any absence from work in respect of her pregnancy for a period not exceeding 12 months or any longer period that may be specified in the relevant employment agreement; <br />(j) any other absence approved by his or her employer either before or after it occurs. <br />(3) If the employment of an employee who was apprenticed to an employer is continued by the employer within 12 months after the completion of the apprenticeship, the period of the apprenticeship is to be counted as part of the continuous employment of the employee with that employer. <br />(4) Sub-section (3) applies regardless of whether the continuation occurred before or after the commencement of this Division. <br />(5) For the purposes of this Division, the continuous employment by an employer of an employee who is employed by the employer at the commencement of this Division is to be regarded as starting at the actual day (before the commencement of this Division) of that employment.”</p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;The Act employs only the general term “employee”, which it defines in s59 for the purposes of Division 6. It does not refer to, or discriminate between, different categories of employees based on the full-time, part-time or casual nature of their employment. </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;The question determined by the learned magistrate in the present case was whether the relevant provisions of the Act applied to an employee such as Mr&nbsp;Clohesy, whose employment was indisputably “casual” in nature, in the sense that it involved, as the magistrate found, a series of ad hoc contracts of employment which lasted only for the duration of each successive event, between which Mr Clohesy neither performed any work for the MCC as a matter of fact, nor had any legal obligation or entitlement to work in future. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;While the reference in s1 of the Act to the legislative purpose of making provision “with respect to the long service leave entitlements of certain employees” indicates that such entitlement is not universal, the Act does not expressly state which employees are excluded from the entitlement, or on what basis. In particular, it does not state that the entitlement does not apply to employees whose employment is casual in nature. The question whether long service leave is available to casual employees such as the respondent must be determined indirectly. It is necessary to consider whether casual employment (in the sense of a series of contracts interspersed between periods when no contractual obligation to provide service subsists) constitutes “continuous employment” within terms of s56 of the Act. Several provisions of the Act throw light on the meaning of “continuous employment”. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;The definition of “employee” in s59 of the Act states that an “employee” for the purposes of Division 6 means “a person employed by an employer to do any work for hire or reward, and includes an apprentice and any person whose contract of employment requires him or her to learn or to be taught any occupation”. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;Section 62, although headed “meaning of continuous employment”, does not offer a comprehensive definition of the term. It does not indicate expressly whether “continuous employment” contemplates any one of a number of possible alternatives, including:<br />&nbsp;<br />(a) a continuous performance of work on a standard “full-time” basis; <br />(b) alternatively, a continuous subsistence of a mutual contractual obligation to offer and perform employment, existing between one employer (as expansively defined in s.60), and an employee. <br />(c) both a continuous performance of employment in fact and a continuous mutual contractual obligation to offer and perform employment; or <br />(d) requirements other than any of the above. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;Section 62, in expressly providing that the specified situations will not constitute interruptions of continuous employment for the purposes of Division 6, implicitly acknowledges that, save for the statutory provision, they might do so. Some of the situations set out in s62 involve cessation of the performance of work in fact, in circumstances where the contract of employment would, by reference to the usual criteria, continue.[3] </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;Some of the situations addressed by s62 contemplate, at least potentially, both the cessation of the performance of work in fact and the cessation of contractual obligations.[4] Section 62(2)(f) appears to contemplate an interruption on either or both bases. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;It might be concluded that because the situations set out in s62 indicate that either an interruption of the contractual relationship or the de facto performance of work could, but for the statutory provision, constitute an interruption of “continuous employment”, “continuous employment” contemplates both a continuous contractual relationship and a continuous performance of work. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;The provisions of the Act relevant to the present appeal have remained substantially unchanged since their introduction in 1953. </p>\r\n<p>Brief History of Victorian Long Service Leave Legislation<br />26.&nbsp;Entitlement to long service leave was introduced in Victoria for the first time in 1862 with the enactment of the Civil Service Act, which provided for six months’ leave to persons who had rendered ten years of civil service in the colony. The availability of the entitlement was subsequently extended, and, by 1953, many employees of State and Commonwealth government departments, statutory corporations and certain private employers were accorded an entitlement to long service leave.[5] </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;In 1953 the Victorian Parliament enacted the Factories and Shops (Long Service Leave) Act 1953 (“the 1953 Act”). Section 7 of the 1953 Act relevantly states:<br />&nbsp;<br />“(1) Subject to this Act every worker shall be entitled to long service leave on ordinary pay in respect of continuous employment with one and same employer. <br />(2) The amount of such entitlement shall be— <br />(a) on the completion by a worker of twenty years continuous employment with his employer- thirteen weeks long service leave and thereafter an additional three and a quarter weeks long service leave on the completion of each additional five years of continuous employment with such employer”.</p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;The term ''worker'' was defined in section 2 of the 1953 Act as: <br />“any person employed by any employer to do any work for hire or reward and includes an apprentice and any other person whose contract of employment requires him to learn or to be taught any occupation”.</p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;Section 3 of the 1953 Act outlined those situations where an worker’s employment would be deemed continuous. The section states:<br />&nbsp;<br />“For the purposes of this Act employment (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) shall be deemed to be continuous notwithstanding—<br />(a) the taking of any annual leave or long service leave; <br />(b) any absence from work of not more than fourteen days in any year on account of illness or injury; <br />(c) any interruption or ending of the employment by the employer if such interruption or ending is made with the intention of avoiding obligations in respect of long service leave or annual leave; <br />(d) any interruption arising directly or indirectly from an industrial dispute; <br />(e) the dismissal of a worker if he is re-employed within a period not exceeding two months from the date of such dismissal; <br />(f) the standing down of a worker on account of slackness of trade; <br />(g) any other absence of the worker by leave of the employer, or on account of injury arising out of or in the course of his employment”.</p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;On moving the Second Reading of the Factories and Shops (Long Service Leave) Bill 1953, the Honourable A. M. Fraser, Minister of Labour described long service leave as “a period of rest to the employee, so that he might recuperate after a long period of continuous service”.[6] </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;He stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“The employee who, for a continuous period of twenty years, has played the game faithfully with the one employer is entitled to a short period of rest without any financial sacrifice to himself”.[7] </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;Sections 7 and 3 of the Factories and Shops (Long Service Leave) Act 1953 were re-enacted, without alteration, as sections 154 and 151 respectively of the Labour and Industry Act 1953, and subsequently, of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 (“the 1958 Act”), both of which consolidated a range of legislation concerning industrial and employment issues. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;The long service leave provisions contained in the 1958 Act were repealed in 1979, and sections 154 and 151 of the 1958 Act re-enacted as ss.67 and 65 respectively in the Industrial Relations Act 1979 (“the 1979 Act”). The 1979 Act introduced a deeming provision in relation to maternity leave, and made minor adjustments to the periods required to establish eligibility for long service leave. All other relevant aspects of the provisions remained substantively unaltered. Neither the explanatory notes accompanying the Industrial Relations Bill 1979, nor the Second Reading speech to the Legislative Assembly on the introduction of the Bill,[8] elaborated upon the basis of entitlement to long service leave. </p>\r\n<p>34.&nbsp;The 1979 Act was repealed by the Employee Relations Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). The basic entitlement to long service leave was re-enacted as section 56 of the 1992 Act in the following terms:<br />&nbsp;<br />“An employee is entitled to— <br />(a) 13 weeks of long service leave on ordinary pay on completing 15 years of continuous employment with one employer; and <br />(b) 4 1/3 weeks of long service leave on ordinary pay on completing each period of 5 years of continuous employment with that employer after the first 15 years of continuous employment with that employer.”</p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;Whilst the 1992 Act replaced the term `worker’ with the term `employee’, there were no substantive differences in the definitions.[9] The deeming provision was enacted as section 62 of the 1992 Act. Section 62(1) states:<br />&nbsp;<br />“This section sets out several situation in which an employee is to be regarded, for the purposes of this Division, as having been continuously employed even though in a strict legal sense it could be said that the employee’s employment was interrupted.</p>\r\n<p>36.&nbsp;Section 62(2) of the 1992 Act outlines those situations deemed not to be an interruption of “continuous employment” for the purposes of the 1992 Act. Again, they are substantially similar to those in prior repealed Acts. </p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;The 1992 Act was amended by the Commonwealth Powers (Industrial Relations) Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”), the purpose of which was to refer Victoria’s industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth Government. Under s5(1)(d)(v) of the 1996 Act, provision to legislate on the subject of long service leave was excluded from the reference. Those provisions of the 1992 Act no longer required after the referral were repealed, leaving long service leave as the major remaining topic dealt with by the 1992 Act. Accordingly, under section 9 of the 1996 Act, the 1992 Act was retitled the “Long Service Leave Act 1992”. The 1996 Act did not, however, make any substantive amendment to the provisions of the 1992 Act relating to long service leave entitlement. Further, there was no more than a cursory reference in the extrinsic material to the subject of long service leave.[10] </p>\r\n<p>Long Service Leave Legislation in other Jurisdictions<br />38.&nbsp;Long service leave was introduced in other states as a minimum legislative entitlement for all employees throughout the 1950s. Such legislation was enacted in broadly similar terms to the 1953 Victorian Act, with entitlement to long service leave appearing to require the existence of an unbroken contract of employment.[11] </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;Subsequent amendments to long service leave legislation in all states, with the exception of Victoria, make specific reference to the long service leave entitlement of casual employees. </p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;In New South Wales, section 4(1) of the Long Service Leave Act 1955 (NSW) relevantly states:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Except as otherwise provided in this Act, every worker shall be entitled to long service leave on ordinary pay in respect of the service of the worker with an employer”.</p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;''Service'' is defined in section 4(11)(a) of the 1955 Act, which states:<br />&nbsp;<br />“For the purposes of this section:<br />(a) service of a worker with an employer means continues service, whether on a permanent, casual, part-time or any other basis, under one or more contracts of employment.”</p>\r\n<p>42.&nbsp;Section 4(11)(a) was inserted into the Long Service Leave Act 1955 (NSW) in 1985.[12] In his Second Reading speech to the Legislative Assembly on the introduction of the Bill, Mr Hills, Minister for Industrial Relations, stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“The Long Service Leave Act presently provides that long service leave is earned on the basis of an unbroken contract of employment. This has been a continual problem in respect of long service leave entitlement because it has acted against the interests of casual employees, many of whom have been continuously employed for periods in excess of ten years but whose contract of employment is deemed to be terminated each time they are paid. This amendment will ensure that legal technicalities cannot deprive a worker from a just entitlement to long service leave. It will ensure that so long as the worker has worked continuously for an employer for the qualifying period, the worker will receive a long service leave entitlement, regardless of whether that worker was employed on a permanent, casual, part-time or any other basis, and whether or not under one or more contracts of employment”.[13]</p>\r\n<p>43.&nbsp;By comparison, section 47 of the Industrial Relations Act 1999 (Qld) states: <br />“(1) The service of an employee (a “casual employee”) who is employed more than once by the same employer over a period is continuous service with the employer even though— <br />(a) the employment is broken; or <br />(b) any of the employment is not full-time employment; or <br />(c) the employee is employed by the employer under 2 or more employment contract; or <br />(d) the employee would, apart from this section, be taken to be engaged in casual employment; or <br />(e) the employee has engaged in other employment during the period. </p>\r\n<p>44.&nbsp;The Long Service Leave Act 1976 (ACT) similarly contains express provisions relating to casual employees. Section 2 states that the term employee includes “a casual employee”, defined as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“casual employee means a person who is, from time to time offered regular and systematic employment on the basis that the offer of employment might be accepted or rejected and in circumstances where it could be expected by that person that further employment of the same type would or might be offered and accepted, but in respect of which there is no certainty about the period over which it would continue to be offered.”</p>\r\n<p>45.&nbsp;The Explanatory Memorandum to the Long Service Leave (Amendment) Bill 1997 (ACT) states that the broadening of the definition of “employee” was designed to overcome “any ambiguity in the Act as to its coverage of casual employees”.[14] </p>\r\n<p>Ex parte Kingston<br />46.&nbsp;The Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Ex parte Kingston considered the statutory provisions contained in the Labour and Industry Act 1958 (Vic) governing entitlement to long service leave. </p>\r\n<p>47.&nbsp;The Full Court discharged an order nisi granted at the instance of the applicant, who sought a writ of certiorari and the quashing of the order of the Industrial Appeals Court setting aside a conviction of the defendant company for failing to pay ordinary pay for long service leave to a certain “casual” employee, Mrs&nbsp;Creed. The applicant had been the informant in proceedings before the Metropolitan Industrial Court, which had convicted the defendant company. The defendant company had successfully appealed to the Industrial Appeals Court, which quashed its conviction. Before the Full Court, the applicant sought to quash the order setting aside the conviction. The Full Court recognised that “[T]he issue before both the Metropolitan Industrial Court and the Industrial Appeals Court was whether Mrs Creed was entitled to long service leave ... “[15] </p>\r\n<p>48.&nbsp;The Full Court observed that its own function in deciding whether to grant a writ of certiorari was to determine whether there was an error of law on the face of the record. The Court acknowledged that in that context, “It must adopt any finding of fact made by the Appeals Court. This Court’s only function is to decide whether the applicant has established that an error of law has occurred, and it is even more limited than that, because the applicant must go further and establish that the error of law appears on the face of the record. In proceedings of certiorari, it is emphasised that it is no part of the function of this Court to make findings of fact.”[16] </p>\r\n<p>49.&nbsp;The defendant company disputed that “the record” included the Industrial Appeals Court’s reasons for decision and certain other documents in which the applicant identified alleged errors of law, but contended that in any event, those documents contained no error on their face. The Full Court assumed, without deciding, that the record was composed as the applicant contended, but considered that it contained no error of law. </p>\r\n<p>50.&nbsp;The Full Court accepted the findings of fact of the Industrial Appeals Court, which it set out at length. </p>\r\n<p>51.&nbsp;The relevant employee, Mrs&nbsp;Creed, had worked as a betting operator at city race tracks for the defendant company on a number occasions over a 25 year span. The defendant company “kept a register of persons available for employment. This contained not only the names but the preferences and availability of such persons”.[17] At some stage prior to the relevant event, an estimate of the number of workers of various categories was made and “a selection was then made from the register of names, having regard to such limitations as have been mentioned and also with the object of being as fair as possible in not giving preference to particular persons”.[18] Each person selected was given a ticket for admission, indicating the part of the race course where he or she was to work. The ticket was distributed (or sometimes sent by post in batches) for the future race meeting or meetings. The recipient of such a ticket would simply attend for work as indicated or, if unable or unwilling to do so, was expected to return the ticket as an indication that he or she was not available. </p>\r\n<p>52.&nbsp;When the person worked, he or she was paid at the racecourse in accordance with the applicable determination, which included certain prescribed allowances, including pro rata holiday pay. </p>\r\n<p>53.&nbsp;It was not disputed that Mrs Creed did not work at a significant proportion of race meetings for which she was available. </p>\r\n<p>54.&nbsp;The Industrial Appeals Court had concluded that the defendant company made a separate offer of employment to Mrs Creed at each race meeting, constituted by the delivery of a ticket. “A contract of employment was entered into when the recipient of the ticket attended at the race course or previously notified [the company] that he would attend. The offer of employment was rejected either by the worker returning the ticket or simply not attending”.[19] The Industrial Appeals Court set aside the conviction of the defendant company for failing to pay long service leave to Mrs&nbsp;Creed, made by the Metropolitan Industrial Court. </p>\r\n<p>55.&nbsp;The Industrial Appeals Court’s conclusions were set out in the judgment of the Full Court as follows: <br />“1. If Mrs Creed had presented herself at the totalisator house at a race meeting for which she had not received a ticket or other offer of employment and was told she was not needed, she would certainly have no remedy.<br />2. If, without any prior notification, she had suddenly ceased to receive tickets, she would have no legal cause for complaint. <br />3. If, having received a ticket for a meeting, she simply did not attend, the Appellant would have no cause of action against her for breach of contract of service. <br />It follows that Mrs Creed’s employment at each meeting she attended was pursuant to a separate contract of service specifically for that meeting and was not different in substance to the occasion of which Mrs Creed gave evidence, when she attended a meeting in her capacity as a union official, was asked by a supervisor on the spot if she would work at a window and agreed to do so. <br />This being so, there was not, as there was in Mrs Mansfield’s case, always a subsisting contract of service over the qualifying period and it follows that she was not in ''continuous employment''. <br />This finding disposes of the only basis upon which she was entitled to long service leave, and the appeal will be allowed and the conviction and consequential orders quashed.”[20]</p>\r\n<p>56.&nbsp;The judgment of the Full Court, constituted by Gillard, Menhennitt and Dunn&nbsp;JJ, was delivered by Menhennitt&nbsp;J. His Honour referred to the following alleged errors of law on the face of the record by the Industrial Appeals Court:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. The finding by the Industrial Appeals Court that if, without any prior notification Mrs Creed had suddenly ceased to receive tickets, she would have no legal cause for complaint. <br />2. The finding by that Court that if having received a ticket for a meeting she simply did not attend, the company would have no cause of action against her for breach of contract of service. <br />3. On the facts as found by the Industrial Appeals Court, there existed in law a contractual relationship between Mrs Creed and the company continuously from 1944 until 1970. <br />4. The Industrial Appeals Court was wrong in not holding that the existence of that contractual relationship with the consequential employment envisaged thereby and carried out pursuant thereto was sufficient to constitute continuous employment within s154 of the Labour and Industry Act 1958.[21]</p>\r\n<p>57.&nbsp;The statement of the errors alleged by the applicant in Ex parte Kingston is somewhat puzzling. It would appear that paragraph 3 contains a typographical error, as it is clear from a reading of the reasons that the applicant asserted that the Industrial Appeals Court should have held that there was a contractual relationship between Mrs Creed and the company continuously from 1944 until 1970, rather than asserting such a holding to be erroneous. </p>\r\n<p>58.&nbsp;Further, the alleged error in paragraph 4 would make no sense if the applicant were contending that the Industrial Appeals Court should have found that there was no continuous contractual relationship between Mrs Creed and the employer. <br />59.&nbsp;The Full Court, having noted the alleged errors, stated:[22]<br />&nbsp;<br />“Implicit in the last two of these alleged errors, it was being urged that, for a worker to be entitled to long service leave the worker must have served the necessary continuous employment with one and the same employer pursuant to a contract with the employer which required the worker to work that continuous service, subject to the qualifications in s151(1) of the Act. This, we think, must be so. What s154(1) grants is long service leave. Leave from performing work is only necessary if there is a continuing contract which obliges the worker to continue giving service for his hire or reward. The whole concept of long service leave involves as its prerequisite, the existence of a contract between the employer and the worker whereby the worker otherwise would be obliged to work in the absence of any provision relieving him or her from such obligation. The same underlying concept is recognised in s156(4)(b) of the Act. ... “</p>\r\n<p>60.&nbsp;The Full Court rejected the applicant’s contention that the Industrial Appeals Court made a finding of fact that the arrangement between Mrs Creed and the company constituted a promise to select her name, with the object of being as fair as possible, thus ensuring her a fair share of suitable work.[23] </p>\r\n<p>61.&nbsp;Rather, the Full Court considered that the Industrial Appeals Court expressly found that Mrs Creed had no entitlement to any tickets on any basis or at all, and the company had no contractual entitlement to her attendance, even if she failed to return the ticket. The fact that the company selected ticket recipients on a particular basis which was known to the pool of recipients, did not make it a term of the contract.[24] </p>\r\n<p>62.&nbsp;The Full Court considered that the Industrial Appeals Court has in substance found as a fact, “that there was no contract between the company and Mrs Creed which required the company to give continuous employment to Mrs Creed, or Mrs Creed to give continuous service. There was no mutual contractual obligation.” On the basis of that finding of fact, the Full Court found that it involved no error of law to conclude that Mrs Creed “was not entitled to long service leave”.[25] </p>\r\n<p>63.&nbsp;The Full Court took the view that the fact that Mrs Creed worked a considerable number of days was “quite neutral on the question whether such work was done pursuant to a contract calling for continuous employment.” It was equally consistent with “continuous employment” as distinct from employment pursuant to a separate contract of service for each meeting.[26] </p>\r\n<p>64.&nbsp;The Full Court concluded that “for all of the reasons we have given, the applicant has failed to show any error of law on the record ...”[27] The order nisi was therefore discharged. </p>\r\n<p>The Appeal<br />65.&nbsp;The appellant identifies the questions of law raised by the appeal as:<br />&nbsp;<br />(i) whether the learned magistrate erred in failing to find that the judgment of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v Industrial Appeals Court and Automatic Totalisators Limited; Ex parte Raymond John Kingston (unreported 26 February 1976) prohibited him from holding that the Respondent had completed fifteen years continuous employment with the appellant and was entitled to long service leave under the Act; <br />(ii) whether the learned magistrate erred in the construction that he must be taken to have given the expression “continuous employment” in section 56(a) of the Long Service Leave Act 1992 (Vic) (“the Act”); <br />(iii) whether the learned magistrate erred in construing section 56(a) of the Act to mean that the respondent was entitled to long service leave under the Act because he had given continuous “service” during 15 years as an employee to the appellant as employer; <br />(iv) whether the learned magistrate, having found that the Respondent was under no legally enforceable obligation to attend for work on any day which he had accepted for attendance, erred by not construing section 56(a) of the Act to mean that in those circumstances the respondent had not been in “continuous employment” for 15 years; <br />(v) whether the learned magistrate erred by construing section 56(a) of the Act to mean that in circumstances where the Respondent had not completed fifteen years of continuous employment with the Appellant pursuant to a contract whereby the Appellant was legally obliged to provide the respondent with work and the respondent was legally obliged to perform work for the appellant, the respondent was entitled to long service leave under the Act. </p>\r\n<p>66.&nbsp;Section 109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act provides: <br />“109. Appeal to Supreme Court from final order made in civil proceeding<br />(1) A party to a civil proceeding in the Court may appeal to the Supreme Court, on a question of law, from a final order of the Court in that proceeding. <br />(2) An appeal under sub-section (1— <br />(a) must be instituted not later than 30 days after the day on which the order complained of was made; and <br />(b) does not operate as a stay of any order made by the Court unless the Supreme Court so orders. <br />(3) Subject to sub-section (2), an appeal under sub-section (1) must be brought in accordance with the rules of the Supreme Court. <br />(4) An appeal instituted after the end of the period referred to in sub-section (2)(a) is deemed to be an application for leave to appeal under sub-section (1). <br />(5) The Supreme Court may grant leave under sub-section (4) and the appellant may proceed with the appeal if the Supreme Court— <br />(a) is of the opinion that the failure to institute the appeal within the period referred to in sub-section (2)(a) was due to exceptional circumstances; and <br />(b) is satisfied that the case of any other party to the appeal would not be materially prejudiced because of the delay. <br />(6) After hearing and determining the appeal, the Supreme Court may make such order as it thinks appropriate, including an order remitting the case for re-hearing to the Court with or without any direction in law. <br />(7) An order made by the Supreme Court on an appeal under sub-section (1), other than an order remitting the case for re-hearing to the Court, may be enforced as an order of the Supreme Court. </p>\r\n<p>67.&nbsp;It is not disputed that the order of the learned magistrate was a final order. </p>\r\n<p>68.&nbsp;The principles governing an appeal from the final order of a magistrate are well established. The question of the law the subject of the appeal must be a question which was involved in the decision of the lower court. Although the question itself need not have been decided by, as distinct from involved in, the decision below, it must have been raised. </p>\r\n<p>69.&nbsp;The appeal is an appeal in a strict sense. It is not a rehearing.[28] </p>\r\n<p>The Magistrate’s Decision<br />70.&nbsp;Magistrate Smith identified the ultimate issue as whether Mr Clohesy had satisfied the requirements of s56 of the Act by the completion of 15 years continuous employment. He found that the respondent had satisfied that requirement. </p>\r\n<p>71.&nbsp;Magistrate Smith observed that the Act is remedial or beneficial legislation. The current context for the interpretation of remedial legislation was “the prevailing workplace realities that the permanent five days per week 9-5 employee is no longer the dominant species on the industrial landscape. The concept of service as an employee therefore must take into account the nature of the business of the employer and the manner in which that employer chooses to conduct that business, including the manner in which it chooses to obtain and utilise the services of employees.”[29] </p>\r\n<p>72.&nbsp;He noted that the Act does not have a definition of contract of employment and does not distinguish between casual, part-time or permanent employees or employment. As such, “employment” bore its common law meaning of “any agreement whereby a person is employed by an employer to do any work for hire or reward. When, therefore, section 56 of the Act speaks in terms of `completing 15 years of continuous employment with one employer’, it means that the employee had been in service of one employer for 15 years”, [30]but did not require services pursuant to any single contract of employment for the time. </p>\r\n<p>73.&nbsp;The magistrate rejected the MCC’s contention that there was a distinction between “continuous service” and “continuous employment”. He held the terms to be interchangeable. </p>\r\n<p>74.&nbsp;He held that the category of “casual” employees did not have a precise legal meaning and recognised that a part-time or casual employee might fall within the qualifying requirements of long service leave established by the Act depending on the particular facts or circumstances of the relationship. </p>\r\n<p>75.&nbsp;In that context, the magistrate relied upon Licensed Clubs Association of Victoria v Re Christine Higgins,[31] which set out a number of criteria relevant to determining whether a relationship was a continuing relationship between employer and employee, rather than a series of separate contracts or engagements. </p>\r\n<p>76.&nbsp;He considered that although Licensed Clubs Association of Victoria v Re Christine Higgins was not concerned with the Act, or with long service leave, its approach to identifying continuing employment was “generally apposite” to the present case.[32] </p>\r\n<p>77.&nbsp;The magistrate rejected the MCC’s argument that s56 of the Act implicitly requires continuous employment at common law, as s62 of the Act implicitly assumes that and sets out exhaustively the exceptions to that basic requirement. He did not consider that the specified exceptions were comprehensive. </p>\r\n<p>78.&nbsp;The magistrate held that although the 1998 certified agreement expressly disavowed any entitlement to long service leave, that agreement, and any underlying award, had been replaced by the 2001 certified agreement. Thus, even if the Act specified terms and conditions of employment, there was no inconsistency with the applicable certified agreement within terms of the s170LZ of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth). </p>\r\n<p>79.&nbsp;Most significantly to this appeal, the magistrate expressly rejected the MCC’s contention that the construction by the Full Court of the Supreme Court in Ex parte Kingston of statutory provisions which were relevantly identical to s56 of the Act was binding on him and governed the question whether the requirements of s56 of the Act were satisfied. </p>\r\n<p>80.&nbsp;The learned magistrate acknowledged that the factual situation of Mrs&nbsp;Creed’s employment in Ex parte Kingston bore strong similarities to those of the case before him. Indeed, he apparently regarded any distinctions as immaterial.[33] However, he considered that the Full Court in Ex parte Kingston accepted the facts as found by the Industrial Appeals Court and “the decision of the Full Court therefore was a determination that the lower court did not fall into error of law in reaching its decision in applying the findings of fact which it had made.”[34] </p>\r\n<p>81.&nbsp;The learned magistrate considered that the passage in Ex parte Kingston in which the Full Court construed “continuous employment” s154 of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 to require an ongoing contract imposing a mutual obligation to offer and perform employment was obiter dicta. In consequence, he took the view that he was not bound by the Full Court’s statement, with which he disagreed. </p>\r\n<p>82.&nbsp;He further stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“The Full Court then in effect considered the rationale adopted by the lower court in reaching its determination, and concluded that the applicant’s contention as to the proper conclusion on the facts as found could not be sustained, and that the Industrial Appeals Court was not in error, in not finding on the basis of those facts that the contractual relationship between the parties was sufficient to qualify Mrs&nbsp;Creed on the basis of ''continuous employment'' for long service leave ... “.[35]</p>\r\n<p>83.&nbsp;The magistrate concluded that the statement of principle in Ex parte Kingston was merely obiter and observed that he disagreed “with the apparent emphasis and interpretation made by the Full Court. In particular I do not agree with the statement “the whole concept of long service leave involves as its prerequisite the existence of a contract between the employer and the worker whereby the worker otherwise would be obliged to work in the absence of any provision relieving him or her from such obligation.”[36] </p>\r\n<p>84.&nbsp;The magistrate accepted that “given the nature of the proceeding before that Court [in Ex parte Kingston], neither its decision nor its reasons can be binding in this proceeding. As the Full Court itself specifically made no findings of fact and any apparent endorsement of or comment either upon the findings of fact made by the lower court, or the application by the lower court of those findings of fact to its determination, can only be obiter”.[37] He accepted that “to find otherwise would be in effect to require this Court to be bound not by a decision of the Full Court but by the decision of the Industrial Appeals Court.”[38] </p>\r\n<p>85.&nbsp;The learned magistrate concluded that continuous employment or service for the purposes of the Act did not arise only where there are legally enforceable mutual obligations between the parties, such that one party is obliged to provide work and the other party is obliged to provide service. He stated that, “It is sufficient in my opinion for a state of affairs to have existed whereby an employer has in fact offered employment which can be said in all the circumstances to be continuous, and where the employee has reciprocally, provided that service”.[39] </p>\r\n<p>86.&nbsp;He concluded that “continuous service” depended on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that “In all the circumstances, it is my opinion that Mr&nbsp;Clohesy can fairly be said to have given 15 years of continuous service to the defendant. He is therefore entitled to long service leave to be properly calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act.”[40] </p>\r\n<p>The Parties’ Main Contentions<br />87.&nbsp;Mr Ginnane, senior counsel for the appellant, contended that the decision of the learned magistrate was in error on two closely-related but distinct bases. First, the magistrate failed to apply the decision of the Full Court in Ex parte Kingston, by which he was bound. </p>\r\n<p>88.&nbsp;In that context, the appellant contended that the ratio of Ex parte Kingston was contained in the statement of principle that “continuous employment” within terms of s154(1) of the Labour and Industry Act 1958, founding an entitlement to long service leave, was performance of continuous employment with one employer pursuant to a continuing contract imposing mutual obligations to provide services and employment. </p>\r\n<p>89.&nbsp;The appellant contended that the identification of the ratio of the case must be approached as a matter of substance. Mr Ginnane argued that the magistrate placed undue emphasis on the formulation of the alleged errors of law submitted by the applicant for the writ in Ex parte Kingston. Further, his focus on the dispute over what facts the lower court had or should have found, led him to disregard the fact that the Full Court’s clear construction of the term “continuous employment” underpinned its conclusion that there was no error of law and was necessary to explain its decision. </p>\r\n<p>90.&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Ginnane submitted that even if the ratio decidendi of Ex parte Kingston did not apply to the present case, the construction of the term “continuous employment” in s154(1) of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 by the Full Court in Ex parte Kingston was highly authoritative and constituted settled law. The relevant section had since been successively re-enacted, and now appears as s56 of the Act without any substantial alteration. That circumstance attracted the principle recognised in cases such as Re Alcan Australia Ltd and ors v Ex parte Federation of Industrial Manufacturing and Engineering Employees’ (“Re Alcan”)[41] that Parliament, when it repeated language to which a meaning had been judicially attributed, intended it to bear that meaning. In the present case, there was a strong presumption, in the light of the repeated re-enactment of the provision in similar terms, that the construction adopted by the Full Court accurately reflected legislative intention. The appellant argued that the presumption applied whether or not the Full Court’s construction of the term “continuous employment” in Ex parte Kingston constituted, on analysis, the ratio of that case. As such, the magistrate’s decision disclosed an error of law in terms of s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act, on the independent ground of his failure to apply the settled construction of the statutory term. </p>\r\n<p>91.&nbsp;Mr Farouque, counsel for the respondent, conceded that if the Full Court’s construction of “continuous employment” in Ex parte Kingston constituted the ratio, or part of it, it was binding on the magistrate and the failure to apply it would constitute an error of law within the terms of s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act. The present appeal would be allowed on that basis. He argued, however, that the magistrate’s failure to apply the construction adopted in Ex parte Kingston would constitute an error of law only if it were, or formed part of, the ratio of the case. </p>\r\n<p>92.&nbsp;Mr Farouque further contended that the magistrate’s construction of “continuous employment” in s56 of the Act as service which has in fact been continuously rendered over the course of 15 years, (rather than employment pursuant to an “ongoing” contract of employment involving mutual obligations), was correct. It was, he argued, supported by statements in the second reading speech of the Factories and Shops (Long Service Leave) Act 1953 regarding the underlying purpose of long service leave, which remained relevant in the absence of any further parliamentary statement of significance. Mr Farouque asserted that such statements demonstrated that the primary purpose of long service leave was to reward a continuous period of service by a period of leave without financial penalty, </p>\r\n<p>93.&nbsp;Further, he submitted that the magistrate’s construction accorded with the terms of the legislation and the reality of modern patterns of employment. It obviated unjust anomalies produced by the construction adopted in Ex parte Kingston. In particular, Mr&nbsp;Farouque argued that the requirement for a “continuous contract” operated not only to deprive casual workers of the benefit of long service leave, but could also destroy the entitlement of an employee who had provided 15 years’ continuous service pursuant to different consecutive contracts executed to reflect promotion or other changed circumstances. He rejected the appellant’s contention that such anomalies could be satisfactorily addressed by the negotiation of the parties. </p>\r\n<p>94.&nbsp;The respondent argued that the ratio of Ex parte Kingston was simply that “in the absence of a mutuality of obligation on the part of the company to provide work, and on the part of an employee or a worker to perform work, ... there is no ongoing contract of service”. Mr&nbsp;Farouque submitted that “that was the principle of law to decide the issue before the Full Court, being whether Mrs Creed was engaged under an ongoing contract of service”. It was, in his submission, unnecessary for the Full Court to turn to the construction of the term “continuous employment” under s154 of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 in order to decide the issue that was before it. As such, the Full Court’s observations on the meaning of the term “continuous employment” were obiter and not binding on the learned magistrate, who was entitled to adopt and apply his preferred construction. </p>\r\n<p>Scope of Ratio Decidendi<br />95.&nbsp;In Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd[42] the High Court considered, inter alia, whether the ratio decidendi of Bryan v Maloney[43] applied to the case before it. McHugh&nbsp;J stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“The common law distinguishes between the holding of a case, the rule of the case and its ratio decidendi. The holding of a case is the decision of the court on the precise point in issue - for the plaintiff or the defendant. The rule of the case is the principle for which the case stands - although sometimes judges describe the rule of the case as its holding. The ratio decidendi of the case is the general rule of law that the court propounded as its reasons for the decision. Under the common law system of adjudication, the ratio decidendi of the case binds courts that are lower in the judicial hierarchy than the court deciding the case. Moreover, even courts of co-ordinate authority or higher in the judicial hierarchy will ordinarily refuse to apply the ratio decidendi of a case only when they are convinced that it is wrong. Prima facie, the ratio decidendi and the rule of the case are identical. However, if later courts read down the rule of the case, they may treat the proclaimed ratio decidendi as too broad, too narrow or inapplicable. Later courts may treat the material facts of the case as too broad, too narrow or inapplicable. Later courts may treat the material facts of the case as standing for a narrower or different rule that was formulated by the court that decided the case. Consequently, it may take a series of later cases before the rule of a particular case becomes settled. ... If later courts take the view that the rule of a case was different from its stated ratio decidendi, they may dismiss the stated ratio as a mere dictum or qualify it to accord with rhe rule of the case as now perceived.”[44]</p>\r\n<p>96.&nbsp;His Honour’s analysis of the reasoning in Bryan v Maloney assumed that both the stated reasons of the court and the material facts of the case were relevant to the determination of the ratio of a case. Further, it recognised that the ratio of a case is not an immutable statement, but is, of its nature, susceptible to reformulation by reference both to developments subsequent to the decision and to the particular perspective from which the analysis is made. </p>\r\n<p>97.&nbsp;Similarly, the approach of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon&nbsp;JJ, in their joint judgment, was to ask, as a matter of substance, “What did Bryan v Maloney decide?” and to “identify the reasoning that underpinned [the Court’s] conclusion”.[45] Their Honours then identified the considerations which had led to the Court’s conclusion that a relationship of proximity existed between the builder of a dwelling house and its subsequent owner. They recognised, in that context, that the principal conclusion that the builder owed a duty of care to the subsequent owner to avoid economic loss depended upon conclusions the Court had already reached on the relationship of the first owner and the builder, and, in particular, on the “anterior step” of concluding that the builder owed the first owner such a duty. <br />98.&nbsp;Their Honours also observed that “both the anterior step and the conclusion drawn from it were considered in the context of the facts of the particular case.”[46] </p>\r\n<p>99.&nbsp;The approach of the High Court in Woolcock to the determination of the ratio of a case was to analyse, as a matter of substance, the chain of reasoning underpinning the principal conclusion within the particular factual context of the case. </p>\r\n<p>100.&nbsp;Maher Waller &amp; Derham, in their analysis of the meaning of “ratio decidendi”, state:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Ratio decidendi means, literally, either the ''reason of decision'' or the ''reason for deciding''. Many text writers and some judges have used the term to refer to — <br />(a) the principle or principles of law on which the decision of a case is based; or <br />(b) the principle or principles of law for which a case is authority; and many writers have asserted or assumed that (a) and (b) go together so that in almost all cases both definitions are appropriate. Further, they believe that it is only the ratio decidendi which binds as law anyone other than the parties to the case. This is a misleading view, for decisions of particular issues may bind subsequent courts if the same issues arise again and yet decisions themselves are not aptly referred to as rationes decidendi. <br />We prefer to use the term ratio decidendi to refer to the proposition of law expressed or necessarily implied by a court as providing the legal justification for deciding a case, or a particular issue in a case, in a particular way. This is then the legal ''reason for deciding''. Judicial reasoning may establish such propositions as rationes decidendi. <br />Obiter dictum is used in contradistinction to ratio decidendi to refer to a legal rule or concept (or to its application to another different set of facts) enunciated by a judge not as a ''reason for deciding'' but by the way and as it were gratuitously. Obiter dicta may shed important and persuasive light on the law but they bind no judge or court.”[47]</p>\r\n<p>101.&nbsp;The report of the arguments advanced in Ex parte Kingston is, in some respects, ambiguous. However, it would appear that the applicant in Ex parte Kingston did not dispute that “continuous employment” under s154 of the Labour and Industry Act 1958 (founding an entitlement to long service leave) required service under a continuous contract which required the worker to render service (subject to certain statutory qualifications). The Full Court endorsed that construction by its own observations on the necessity for a continuing contract which obliges the worker to continue giving the service for his hire or reward,[48] (which were repeated at other points of the judgment.) Further, the Full Court at a later point made clear that the relevant contract must also oblige the employer to offer employment. Thus, Ex parte Kingston was determined on the basis of an apparently common assumption that “continuous employment” involved a mutual contractual obligation requiring the employer to offer continuous employment and the employee to render continuous service.[49] </p>\r\n<p>102.&nbsp;The applicant’s alleged errors of law assumed the correctness of that construction. The applicant contended that the errors of law were all founded upon the failure to recognise that, on the facts as found, the requirement for such a contractual relationship was satisfied. </p>\r\n<p>103.&nbsp;At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Farouque argued that the Full Court’s finding that there was no such factual finding was sufficient to dispose of all the errors of law alleged to depend on it. The finding that there were no such errors of law thus did not depend on the court’s construction of “continuous employment” under s154. </p>\r\n<p>104.&nbsp;In my view, the Full Court’s finding that there was no error in the Industrial Appeals Court’s failure to find “continuous employment” within the meaning of the section due to the absence of a finding of a “continuous contract”, necessarily depends on the Full Court’s underlying assumption that a continuous contract was a necessary requirement. But for that assumption, the Full Court would not necessarily have concluded that there was no error in the Industrial Appeals Court’s holding that Mrs Creed’s employment was not “continuous employment”. </p>\r\n<p>105.&nbsp;The Full Court was only able to reach its conclusion that there was no error in the holding that the requirements of continuous employment were unsatisfied because that conclusion was underpinned by a definition of the elements which were, as a matter of legal principle, required. </p>\r\n<p>106.&nbsp;In the present case, the respondent has identified, as the ratio of Ex parte Kingston, a discrete element in the decision-making process of the Full Court. Although the proposition advanced by the respondent is a necessary constituent of the logical chain of reasoning, it is not in itself sufficient to explain or justify the decision, and, when divorced from the logical context, does not illuminate it. </p>\r\n<p>107.&nbsp;The respondent’s approach to the identification of the ratio decidendi of Ex parte Kingston is informed by unduly narrow and artificial distinctions which arise from the technical form of action by which the case was brought. Such an approach, which elevates form over substance, is inconsistent with the High Court’s approach to the identification of the ratio of a case. </p>\r\n<p>108.&nbsp;The logical flaw in the respondent’s analysis is that it has identified as the ratio a mere “anterior step” in a logical chain which is a necessary foundation of, but does not, in itself, dictate, explain, or justify the decision in the case. It is not, in my view, “the general rule of law that the court propounded as the reasons for its decision.” </p>\r\n<p>109.&nbsp;In my opinion, the broad ratio decidendi of Ex parte Kingston is that continuous employment within terms of s56 of the Act requires a continuous contract imposing an obligation on the employer to offer, and on the employee to render, employment. The learned magistrate was bound to apply that ratio. His failure to do so constitutes an error of law pursuant to s109 of the Magstrates’ Court Act. </p>\r\n<p>110.&nbsp;Further, although it is unnecessary to determine the issue, given the view expressed above, I am satisfied that if the ratio of Ex parte Kingston were not, when accurately identified, applicable to the facts of the present case, the Full Court’s clear and deliberate construction of the statutory term “continuous employment” must be assumed to be correct and to accord with legislative intention, on the basis of the established principle recently reaffirmed by the High Court in Re Alcan. </p>\r\n<p>111.&nbsp;The High Court in Re Alcan declined to reconsider the construction in Reg v Portus; Ex parte ANZ Banking Group Ltd[50] of the term “industrial dispute” in industrial relations legislation. Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, in their joint judgment, stated:<br />&nbsp;<br />“There are, in our view, three matters which tell persuasively against reconsideration of Reg v Portus. The first is that the principle on which it proceeds, namely, that for a matter to ''pertain to the relations of employers and employees'' it must affect them in their capacity as such, has been accepted as correct in a number of subsequent cases, with no question ever arising as to whether the principle was correctly applied in the case. The second is that Parliament re-enacted, in s4(1) of the Act, words which are almost identical with those considered in Reg v Portus. There is abundant authority for the proposition that where the Parliament repeats words which have been judicially construed, it is taken to have intended the words to bear the meaning already ''judicially attributed to [them]'', although the validity of that proposition has been questioned. But the presumption is considerably strengthened in the present case by the legislative history of the Act. ... The third matter that tells against a reconsideration of Reg v Portus is that, academic criticism notwithstanding, there is no reason to think it is in any way affected by error.”[51]</p>\r\n<p>112.&nbsp;While the joint judgment observes that the validity of the proposition has, on occasion, been questioned, it assumes that the presumption will apply, whilst recognising that its strength will vary according to particular circumstances. The High Court’s articulation of the presumption does not limit its application to constructions which form part of the ratio of the case. It indicates that it will prima facie apply where there has been a judicial attribution of meaning to certain words, which parliament subsequently repeats in legislation. </p>\r\n<p>113.&nbsp;While the respondent relied on statements in relevant authorities that the presumption did not apply in relation to consolidations,[52] in the case of s56 of the Act, re-enactment of the provision construed by the Full Court has not been confined to consolidations. </p>\r\n<p>114.&nbsp;Similarly, the recent authoritative exposition of the relevant principle or presumption in the joint judgment of all seven justices of the High Court, does not support the restricted application to constructions which form part of the ratio, for which the respondent contends. The High Court’s approach in Re Alcan is, of course, consistent with the view that the presumption would be weaker if the construction were merely incidental or peripheral to the principal issues for determination in the case. </p>\r\n<p>115.&nbsp;In the early case of Williams v Dunn’s Assignee[53] Barton J stated:[54]<br />&nbsp;<br />“If there is a succession of decisions arrived at upon full argument and consideration upon the exact point, it may be assumed that Parliament has acted upon the basis of those decisions and adopted them. But if the decisions are not of that kind, and are, moreover, doubtful in themselves, I do not think it can be assumed that Parliament paid attention to them at all. Because, upon the discovery of the slender basis upon which the original decision, which was afterwards followed, rests, and especially upon finding that a Court of superior authority has in the interim given a different decision, the expectation would be that Parliament, in using the words again, would not use them in the sense attributed to them by decisions found to be weak in their authority, and not founded upon sufficient discussion. That being, as a matter of common sense, the way in which we should interpret the much discussed rule as to the circumstances in which Parliament may be taken to act upon judicial construction, it is not to be supposed that Parliament attributed to the words used here the construction that had been put upon them by the Courts.”</p>\r\n<p>116.&nbsp;His Honour’s observation does not, in my view, support the restriction advocated by the respondent. Rather, it requires that the construction be deliberate and central to the reasoning in the case rather than gratuitous, inadvertent or marginal. </p>\r\n<p>117.&nbsp;In Ex parte Kingston the Full Court’s construction of “continuous employment” was clear, deliberate and fundamental to its reasoning. Successive legislation, including consolidations and amending statutes, has employed the same term substantially unaltered. It may be inferred that, until the terminology is changed, the construction propounded in Ex parte Kingston represents parliament’s intention, and should be applied. </p>\r\n<p>118.&nbsp;In such circumstances, the failure of the learned magistrate to apply a construction enunciated by the State’s highest court and endorsed by the legislature’s subsequent re-enactment in substantially identical terms, constitutes an independent error of law within terms of s109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act. </p>\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />119.&nbsp;As the learned magistrate observed, widespread casual work appears to be a feature of modern patterns of employment. Casual workers may have little real control over their employment status. The impact of the restrictive requirement of a “continuous contract”, upon such workers may, as the respondent contends, be anomalous and in some circumstances, potentially unjust. Courts, however, rarely command the comprehensive information necessary to reach conclusions on the wide-ranging effects of differing patterns of employment. Moreover, it is no part of their valid function indirectly to effect legislative amendment, however desirable amendment may seem. </p>\r\n<p>120.&nbsp;In my opinion, for the reasons set out in detail above, the errors of law identified by the appellant are established. The appeal should be allowed.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________ <br />[1] Francis Clohesy v Melbourne Cricket Club (Victorian Magistrates’ Court, Smith M, 5 July 2004) hereinafter referred to as “Clohesy v MCC”. <br />[2] (Full Court, Supreme Court of Victoria, Unreported 26 February 1976, Gillard, Menhennitt and Dunn&nbsp;JJ) hereinafter referred to as “Ex parte Kingston”. <br />[3] See s62(2)(a) - (c), (h), (i) and (j). <br />[4] Section 2(d) and (g) and s62(3). <br />[5] Victoria, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Council, 22 September 1953, 981-984 (A.M.

When the rental fell into arrears, the lessor issued proceedings in the Magistrates'' Court to recover the unpaid rent. In its defence, the lessee denied the claim and stated that the court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the proceedings and alternatively the proceedings should be stayed.The magistrate refused the application for a stay and set the matter down for hearing. Upon application for review­—<br />HELD: Application dismissed.<br />1.&nbsp;The general scheme of the Retail Leases Act 2003 (Act) is that disputes under retail premises leases, other than those relating solely to the payment of rent and a couple of other exceptions can only be heard by VCAT. Retail premises are relevantly defined as premises that under the terms of the lease are to be used wholly or predominantly for the sale or hire of goods by retail or the retail provision of services. Section 81(1) defines a retail tenancy dispute as including “a dispute between a landlord and tenant arising under or in relation to a retail premises lease to which this or previous Acts applied”. Section 81(2) excludes from the definition of a retail tenancy dispute a dispute “solely relating to the payment of rent”. <br />2. &nbsp;The obligation to pay interest on outstanding rent is not in the same category as other types of dispute that might arise under retail leases. It is a secondary entitlement which only arises if the primary entitlement to rent has been established. Calculating interest generally involves no more than a mathematical exercise flowing from the application of the interest provision to the rent which has been found to be owing. It seems unlikely that Parliament would have intended that the courts could deal with disputes as to the non-payment of rent, but not a dispute as to the interest payable on that rent. The consequence of the tenant’s argument would be that, as soon as contractual interest was claimed, the courts would cease to have jurisdiction and only VCAT could deal with the matter. It cannot be said that the magistrate erred in refusing to stay the proceeding on this ground. <br />3.&nbsp;The evidence before the magistrate was not sufficient to establish that the premises were used “wholly or predominantly” for the provision of retail services or goods, as required by s4(1) of the Act. Given that finding, it cannot be said that the magistrate erred in refusing to stay the proceedings.<br />HOLLINGWORTH J:<br />Introduction<br />1.&nbsp;The plaintiff’s originating motion and summons dated 14 April 2005 seek relief in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the second defendant (“the magistrate”), made on 21 March 2005. The magistrate refused the plaintiff’s application dated 16 March 2005 for a stay of Magistrates’ Court proceeding No S02639995 (“the MC proceeding”) pursuant to s.112 of the Fair Trading Act 1999 (“FTA”) or ss87 and 89 of the Retail Leases Act 2003, on the basis that the dispute ought to be determined by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (“VCAT”). The plaintiff also seeks an order from this court, staying the MC proceeding. </p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;By a lease dated 28 April 2003, the first defendants (“the landlord”) leased office premises at Suite 4, 1st Floor, 23 Ringwood Street, Ringwood to the plaintiff (“the tenant”). The term of the lease was for three years commencing on 1 June 2003. The initial annual rental was $30,800 per annum, payable by monthly instalments. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;The landlord issued the MC proceeding on 10 November 2004, seeking $30,203.05 in respect of unpaid rent between 1 June 2003 and 30 September 2004 and $1,496.06 for interest to 30 September 2004. On 17 November 2004 the tenant filed a defence in the MC proceeding. The defence contained a bare denial of liability, together with a pleading in the following terms: </p>\r\n<p>“That this Honourable Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with these proceedings, alternatively this proceeding should be stayed.<br />PARTICULARS<br />(a) That the lease the subject of these proceedings is a Retail Lease within the meaning of the Retail Leases Act 2003 and the plaintiff does not have the certification as required by s87 of that Act; <br />(b) Alternatively, pursuant to s112 of the Fair Trading Act, this proceeding should be stayed.”</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;The defence did not foreshadow any counter-claim or allege that the rent was not recoverable due to non-service of a disclosure notice. Although the defence asserted that the proceeding should be stayed, no application for a stay was issued until 16 March 2005, some four months later. </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;The material which was filed in support of the stay application included the affidavit of Gary David Goldsmith, the tenant’s solicitor, sworn 16 March 2005. The exhibits to that affidavit included proposed points of claim in VCAT, which, although dated November 2004, have still not been issued. The only allegations in the proposed VCAT claim arise out of the breakdown of the air-conditioning system at the premises on 8 December 2003. The claim for damages is based on breach of an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, breach of a duty of care or breach of an implied term to repair plant and equipment. The proposed VCAT claim did not seek the recovery of rent already paid, on the basis that a disclosure statement was required by statute but had not been provided by the landlord. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;On 21 March 2005 the magistrate refused to grant the stay. No written reasons for decision were given. However, the transcript of the hearing, including the magistrate’s oral reasons, was tendered before me. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;The present proceeding is brought pursuant to common law and O.56 of the Supreme Court Rules. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;The tenant says, in summary, that the magistrate committed the following errors. First, he held that “rent”, for the purposes of the Retail Leases Act 2003, does not include interest under a lease. Secondly, he failed to have regard to and misapplied the decision of Nathan J in Zambelis v Nahas[1]. It is said that the tenant has a counterclaim in relation to the air-conditioning system dispute and the non-provision of a disclosure statement, and that applying the decision in Zambelis should have resulted in a stay being granted. Thirdly, he failed to stay the proceedings under s112 of the FTA. These are said to be either jurisdictional errors or errors on the face of the record. </p>\r\n<p>9.&nbsp;The final ground relied upon by the tenant is that the magistrate went into the merits of a possible defence in relation to an implied covenant of peaceful enjoyment. It is said that the tenant was not given an opportunity to address the magistrate on this point, and that the magistrate’s reasoning affected his thinking on the stay application. It is alleged that this amounted to a denial of procedural fairness. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;An appearance has been entered on behalf of the magistrate, who has indicated in accordance with usual practice that he does not intend to appear and will abide by any order of this court. </p>\r\n<p>Relevant legal principles<br />11.&nbsp;The court must define what “the record” is in this case. It is well established that the record includes the documents which initiated the impugned process - in this case, the materials in support of the stay application – the pleadings and the impugned order itself. Both parties proceeded on the basis that the transcript of argument, which includes the magistrate’s reasons for decision, formed part of the record in this case. Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to consider the debate in the authorities as to whether the record includes the reasons for decision. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;Errors of law can occur at a number of stages, namely at the time of the finding of primary facts, the directing of oneself as to the law or the applying of the law to the facts found. I also note that it is clear that the error must be apparent on the face of the record. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;I turn to consider the relevant provisions of the Retail Leases Act 2003. The general scheme of the Act is that disputes under retail premises leases, other than those relating solely to the payment of rent and a couple of other exceptions which do not concern us, can only be heard by VCAT.[2] Retail premises are relevantly defined as premises that under the terms of the lease are to be used wholly or predominantly for the sale or hire of goods by retail or the retail provision of services.[3] </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;Section 81(1) defines a retail tenancy dispute. The definition includes “a dispute between a landlord and tenant arising under or in relation to a retail premises lease to which this or previous Acts applied”. Section 81(2) excludes from the definition of a retail tenancy dispute a dispute “solely relating to the payment of rent” or another exclusion which is not relevant here. This provision is relevantly similar to the provision in the 1986 Act which was under consideration in the Zambelis case. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;Finally, s87 provides that a retail tenancy dispute can only be the subject of proceedings in VCAT if the Small Business Commissioner has certified in writing that mediation or alternative dispute resolution has failed or is unlikely to resolve the dispute. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;The other statutory provision relied upon by the tenant is s112 of the FTA, which applies where a person commences court proceedings which arise wholly or predominantly from a “consumer and trader dispute”, or are other proceedings in respect of which VCAT has jurisdiction under the FTA. The section requires the court to stay the proceedings if they could be heard by VCAT and the court is satisfied that the proceedings would be more appropriately dealt with by VCAT. In considering questions of appropriateness, the court must consider the relative advantages and disadvantages to the parties (in terms of costs, duration and any other matters the court considers relevant) of having the proceedings determined by VCAT. </p>\r\n<p>The alleged errors<br />The interest claim<br />17.&nbsp;The landlord claims rent and interest under the lease. That contractual interest is set at 2% p.a. higher than the relevant rate under the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983. Does the Magistrates’ Court have jurisdiction to consider such a claim for contractual interest? </p>\r\n<p>18.&nbsp;The tenant says that although statutory interest on rent may be awarded outside VCAT, contractual interest may not be. It argued that contractual interest is analogous to any other covenant to pay something other than rent. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;On the other hand, the landlord argued that contractual interest on rent is not beyond the jurisdiction of the Magistrates’ Court. Furthermore, the landlord said that if it is wrong in relation to that, it will waive any entitlement to contractual interest and only claim statutory interest. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;The magistrate held that the expression “rent”, when used in the relevant Act, covers a claim for rent and interest. Accordingly, he did not go on to consider the effect of the landlord’s offer to waive contractual interest. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;There appears to be no authority in relation to this question. None was referred to me by either counsel and in the limited time available to me I have not located any authority on this point. However, I make the following observations. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;The obligation to pay interest on outstanding rent is not in the same category as other types of dispute that might arise under retail leases. It is a secondary entitlement which only arises if the primary entitlement to rent has been established. Calculating interest generally involves no more than a mathematical exercise flowing from the application of the interest provision to the rent which has been found to be owing. It seems to me unlikely that parliament would have intended that the courts could deal with disputes as to the non-payment of rent, but not a dispute as to the interest payable on that rent. The consequence of the tenant’s argument would be that, as soon as contractual interest was claimed, the courts would cease to have jurisdiction and only VCAT could deal with the matter. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;In any event, given the landlord’s concession that, if need be, it will waive contractual interest and only seek statutory interest, it cannot be said that the magistrate erred in refusing to stay the proceeding on this ground. </p>\r\n<p>Counterclaim<br />24.&nbsp;In the Zambelis case, the plaintiff landlord had brought proceedings for payment of rent. The defendant tenant had filed a defence and brought a cross-claim which raised alleged breaches of covenant by the landlord. There was no dispute in that case that the premises were retail premises covered by the 1986 Act. Nathan J held that because the dispute had broadened beyond the landlord’s claim for rent, the court had no jurisdiction to hear the dispute and it should be referred to arbitration, as required by the Act which was the relevant predecessor to the Retail Leases Act 2003. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;In the present case, it is conceded by the landlord that if the magistrate had concluded that he had a retail tenancy dispute before him, then he should have stayed the proceeding. However, the landlord says that the magistrate was entitled to conclude that the tenant had not established that there was a retail tenancy dispute before him. In fact, the magistrate made no express finding in relation to this point and, on one reading of his ruling, he appears to have proceeded on the assumption that he may have had a retail tenancy dispute before him. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;In my opinion, the evidence before the magistrate was not sufficient to establish that the premises were used “wholly or predominantly” for the provision of retail services or goods, as required by s4(1). Given that finding, it was not necessary for the magistrate to go on to consider whether or not a disclosure statement was in fact provided or into a consideration of any express or implied covenants in the lease. Nor is it necessary for me to resolve any of the factual issues raised by counsel in relation to those matters. </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;To the extent that he may have proceeded on the basis that the lease before him was a retail premises lease, the magistrate seems to have fallen into error. </p>\r\n<p>FTA <br />28.&nbsp;Unlike the retail tenancy legislation, VCAT’s jurisdiction under the FTA is not exclusive. The court has a discretion as to whether the proceedings commenced in a court would be “more appropriately” dealt with by VCAT. Issues such as costs and duration are amongst the matters to which the court may have regard. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;Any claim which might be brought by the tenant in VCAT has been threatened for more than a year, but still not commenced. A hearing in VCAT would presumably not occur for at least some months after any proceedings are finally issued (if they are ever issued). The successful party in VCAT proceedings would not recover their legal costs in the absence of special circumstances. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;On the other hand, the rent dispute can be heard and determined tomorrow in the Magistrates’ Court. The successful party can expect to recover costs in the usual way. The only issue currently pleaded in the MC proceeding relates to rent. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;The claim for rent could not be more appropriately determined in VCAT (assuming for present purposes that it had the necessary jurisdiction). </p>\r\n<p>32.&nbsp;The refusal of a stay does not preclude the tenant from bringing a claim in respect of the air-conditioning issue, if it genuinely wishes to do so. </p>\r\n<p>33.&nbsp;Accordingly, it cannot be said that the magistrate erred in refusing to stay the MC proceeding pursuant to s112. </p>\r\n<p>Implied covenant<br />34.&nbsp;Finally, I consider the procedural fairness argument. The magistrate considered the merits of a possible defence in relation to the implied covenant of peaceful enjoyment. </p>\r\n<p>35.&nbsp;It is said by the tenant that it was not given an opportunity to address in relation to that. The transcript of proceedings before the magistrate establishes that the landlord’s counsel took the magistrate to the implied covenant and addressed in relation to it. Counsel for the tenant then exercised his right of reply. It seems to me from a reading of the transcript that he could have addressed on the topic but chose not to do so. It certainly cannot be said that the tenant’s counsel had no opportunity to address on the matter. Further, it is not clear what, if any, impact this consideration of the implied covenant had on the magistrate’s reasoning on the stay application. </p>\r\n<p>Discretionary considerations<br />36.&nbsp;In so fas as any error has been demonstrated, I would refuse to grant the relief sought on discretionary grounds. It is now well established that the court has a discretion to refuse certiorari even though grounds have been made out. It is a general discretion, although it is helpful to have regard to precedent. The discretion is commonly invoked in cases where it is thought preferable in the circumstances for the applicant to pursue the normal appeal processes. </p>\r\n<p>37.&nbsp;If the magistrate who hears the trial purports to exercise a jurisdiction which he or she does not have, the tenant will have such rights of appeal as would lie from a final judgment of the Magistrates’ Court. At trial the court will have before it all relevant evidence[4] and could be expected to give more detailed reasons for decision than occurred on the interlocutory application. It seems preferable in this case to leave any jurisdictional issues to be determined through the normal appeal process. </p>\r\n<p>38.&nbsp;A further relevant discretionary consideration is this. Relief in the nature of certiorari quashes the impugned decision. It does not compel the decision-maker to start again. Furthermore, the superior court cannot substitute its own decision for that which is quashed.[5] Were I to order relief in the nature of certiorari here, I would not grant a stay of the MC proceeding, the trial of which is due to commence tomorrow. Nor could I compel the Magistrates’ Court to re-hear the stay application in advance of the trial. </p>\r\n<p>39.&nbsp;The tenant’s own conduct has resulted in the present unsatisfactory situation. Although it foreshadowed a stay application in November last year, it took some four months to get around to issuing such an application. It then did so on inadequate material. Its supporting affidavit material also raised no factual matters which had not been known to the tenant for a year or so; that is to say, no new material that might have justified a late application. </p>\r\n<p>40.&nbsp;At the time of refusing the stay application, the magistrate said that the matter should be set down for trial some two weeks thence. In fact, apparently due to case listing considerations, the trial date which was given was some six weeks from the stay application. The tenant then waited more than three weeks after the magistrate’s decision before even filing the current application for judicial review. The first return before a master of this court occurred on 6 May 2005. I am not aware of any attempt on the part of the tenant to have the first return, which is a mere formality, occur earlier than that date (either before a master or a judge in the Practice Court) on the basis of urgency. Unfortunately, this has led to the current situation in which the application for judicial review is brought on in a busy Practice Court, only a few days before the Magistrates’ Court trial is due to commence. Even if relief in the nature of certiorari were ordered, it may well be that it would cause considerable expense and inconvenience for no appreciable benefit in the present case. </p>\r\n<p>41.&nbsp;This delay occurs against a backdrop in which the tenant has still not issued VCAT proceedings in respect of the air-conditioning breakdown of December 2003, notwithstanding its numerous threats to do so over the past year. It only sought the necessary certificate from the Small Business Commissioner on 4 April 2005, after it was unsuccessful in its stay application. Even though alternative dispute resolution is at the heart of the statutory scheme, the tenant’s solicitors sought the certificate without first seeking to have the matter mediated, on the bald assertion that “we do not believe that mediation would be useful in this matter.” The certificate was granted on 22 April 2005 but proceedings have still not been issued. </p>\r\n<p>42.&nbsp;The way in which the tenant has sought to quantify its air-conditioning claim also leads to concerns that the claim is part of some sort of stalling tactic to avoid paying outstanding rent. When the air-conditioner first broke down, the tenant said it would lose $3,000 per day if it had to send its staff home. A few days later, the tenant claimed that it was losing $12,000 per day, but would only claim $3,000 from the landlord. On 19 December 2003, it rendered an invoice for about $22,000, being about $3,000 per day for 7 days. Now the tenant says it has a claim for $309,000 because the office air-conditioner was out of action for a total of 8 days, including a weekend. Leaving aside the serious factual dispute as to whether the staff were in fact sent home or the business shut down for some or all of that time, the tenant has made no attempt to explain in the proposed VCAT claim or the solicitors’ correspondence how such a sum has been calculated or can be justified. The delay in commencing VCAT proceedings seems even more remarkable if the quantum is truly in excess of $300,000. </p>\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />43.&nbsp;For those reasons, the plaintiff’s application by originating motion dated 14 April will be dismissed. </p>\r\n<p>44.&nbsp;I will make the following orders: <br />The plaintiff’s application by originating motion dated 14 April 2005 be dismissed. <br />The plaintiff pay the first defendants’ costs of this proceeding, including reserved costs.<br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] (1991) V Conv R 54-396. <br />[2] Section 89. <br />[3] Section 4(1). <br />[4] For example, better evidence as to the use of the premises. <br />[5] Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163.</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: For the plaintiff Development One Pty Ltd: Mr M Goldblatt, counsel.

Some work was done pursuant to the agreement but a dispute developed between the parties which led to a cessation of work. T. later issued proceedings in the Magistrates'' Court claiming payments pursuant to the acceleration provision in the contract of engagement. The magistrate dismissed the claim finding that the claim breached the provisions of section 251L of the Income Tax Assessment Act (Act) and that the acceleration was void as a penalty. Further, that V. was not in breach of the contract. Upon application for review— <br />HELD: Application dismissed.<br />1.&nbsp;The appropriate procedure for T. to have taken was not by way of judicial review but by appeal pursuant to s109 of the Magistrates'' Court Act 1989. As there are no exceptional circumstances, the application for judicial review must fail.<br />2.&nbsp;Obiter: (a) T. was not a registered tax agent at the relevant time. This means that while he was entitled to prepare or lodge a return or other tax document, to give advice on a taxation matter or to deal with the Australian Tax Office, he was prohibited by the Act, from demanding or receiving payment for so doing or from suing for such a fee. There was evidence upon which the magistrate could have found that the statements in the contract were a mere sham; that T. was in fact providing tax services and charging for them at the monthly fee of $82.50. This finding would bring about the dismissal of the claim.<br />(b) As to the operation of the acceleration provision, it should be noted that its impact will depend upon the date of its breach, not the severity of the breach. If it occurs in May, then only one instalment is accelerated; the work done over the preceding 10 months has been paid for. If, as here, it occurs towards the beginning of the year its impact is greater for a year’s payments must be made for no services for the ensuing 10 months. This impact bears no relationship otherwise to the severity of the breach. It was open to the magistrate to treat the clause as a penalty and accordingly was void.</p>\r\n<p>BYRNE J: <br />1.&nbsp;The plaintiff, Terrence John Theunissen, is an accountant carrying on practice in Dandenong under the name Std Accounting. The first defendant, Edmundo Villaseca, conducts a cleaning business. The second defendant, the Magistrates’ Court at Dandenong, has indicated it wishes to take no part in this proceeding but is content to abide by the order of the court, as is the usual practice.<br />&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp;In mid 2004 Mr Villaseca engaged Mr Theunissen to provide certain accounting services. For this purpose they executed an agreement in writing dated 12 July 2004. The services to be provided under this agreement are expressed to be for the financial year ending 30 June 2004. </p>\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;In the document, the services are set out as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />“Monthly Cash Book reconciliation’s and printouts thereof. <br />Monthly postings of above to General Ledger entries plus Trial Balance <br />General Ledger Spreadsheet update and printout.”</p>\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;In the document, the printed charging rates for these items are struck out and provision is made for payment of what is called a flat fee of $82.50 per month. There is in the document provision for the performance of other services, but the boxes beside these are not ticked. These services include the following, beside each of which the fee is struck out and written in its place the words: “No charge”: </p>\r\n<p>“BAS Return details only. (Responsibility for completing and submitting BAS return to the ATO remains with The Client). <br />Income tax return details only. (Responsibility for completing Tax Return to the ATO remains with The Client.)"</p>\r\n<p>Beneath this in handwriting appears the following:<br />&nbsp;<br />“All outstanding GST against expenses for 2003-2004 to be claimed from ATO.” </p>\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;It seems that notwithstanding this document, what Mr Villaseca wanted to be done immediately in July 2003 was that Mr Theunissen revisit his accounts for the year just completed, which accounts had been prepared by another accountant, and to recover GST payments to which he thought he was entitled. For this Mr Theunissen charged, and Mr Villaseca paid, $1,000. </p>\r\n<p>6.&nbsp;This work was done but no recoveries of overpaid GST were made. The situation then becomes somewhat obscure. Mr Villaseca, on 30 August 2004, paid to Mr Theunissen the sum of $164 for which he received a receipt which stated that the payment was made in respect of “Accounting service re: July/August 2004”. Why this payment was $164 rather than $165, as per the engagement agreement, is uncertain. </p>\r\n<p>7.&nbsp;Furthermore, no accounting services were provided in those months. According to Mr Theunissen, this was because Mr Villaseca failed to provide him with the necessary documentation when he called to collect it on 30 August 2004, as agreed. </p>\r\n<p>8.&nbsp;For some reason the relationship between the two men then became very sour. On 3 September matters came to a head when Mr Theunissen called upon Mr Villaseca again. The bad relations erupted into violence and Mr Theunissen left empty handed. He forwarded to Mr Villaseca on the same day a letter of demand informing his client that he would cease work, that he applied the clause 3 acceleration provision in the contract of engagement and that he would bill the client at the rate of $55 for similar calls made in the past. <br />9.&nbsp;The sum demanded was $1,055. The amount to which Mr Theunissen told me he was entitled was 10 months fees for the balance of the year 2004/2005, namely $825, plus six visits at $55, namely, $330. Again, the reason for the sum demanded being less than $1,155 is obscure. </p>\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;On 24 September a complaint was issued in the Magistrates’ Court at Dandenong seeking $1,055. The defence of Mr Villaseca dated 4 October 2004 raised by way of defence section 251L of the Income Tax Assessment Act and an allegation that the services of Mr Theunissen were discharged on 10 September 2004. </p>\r\n<p>11.&nbsp;The matter came on for hearing before the Magistrates’ Court on 2 December 2004 with Mr Theunissen representing himself and Mr Villaseca represented by counsel. Each of the parties gave evidence and each was cross-examined. At the conclusion of the hearing the magistrate dismissed the claim, with costs of $1,005, granting a stay of one month. Mr Theunissen, being unhappy with this result, has, on 8 December 2004, filed in this court an originating motion seeking judicial review of the magistrate’s decision. Various grounds are specified, most of which appear to be of no relevance to this procedure. </p>\r\n<p>12.&nbsp;On behalf of Mr Villaseca counsel first contended that judicial review is not available, absent exceptional circumstances, or that, as a matter of discretion, I should refuse it on the basis that the appropriate procedure is by appeal under section 109 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1989. This submission is supported by authority which is binding on me,[1] so that this application must fail at this point unless there are exceptional circumstances. None have been asserted and I can see none from my reading of the transcript of the Magistrates’ Court proceeding or the papers before me. That, then, is the end of the matter. </p>\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;Nevertheless, since Mr Theunissen is unrepresented and in the hope that what I say may be of assistance to him, I shall shortly venture my views upon the complaints of substance in his application. </p>\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;The originating motion, as I have mentioned, contains a great variety of peripheral complaints about the proceeding before the magistrate and I shall not dwell upon them. When pressed at the commencement of the hearing Mr Theunissen asserted two matters:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) the magistrate did not apply his mind properly to the facts; and <br />(2) the magistrate denied him the opportunity to call a witness, Gloria Winskewski.<br />&nbsp;<br />To these may be added a third:<br />&nbsp;<br />(3) that he was denied the opportunity to address the court at the conclusion of the evidence. </p>\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;When asked, Mr Theunissen specifically disavowed any contention that the magistrate had committed some error of law. Notwithstanding this, I have examined the material to see if there be any such error. It is clear that in reaching his conclusion the magistrate found adversely to Mr Theunissen as follows:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) that his claim breached section 251L; <br />(2) that clause 3, the acceleration provision, was void as a penalty; and <br />(3) that his claim that Mr Villaseca was in breach of contract was not made out. </p>\r\n<p>I add that in this regard I prefer the tape to the transcript of his Honour’s conclusions. </p>\r\n<p>16.&nbsp;At the commencement of the hearing I explained to Mr Theunissen, and he appeared to understand, that an application for judicial review can succeed only where there is an error of law on the face of the record, or where the order is vitiated by some procedural irregularity. </p>\r\n<p>17.&nbsp;His first complaint that the magistrate failed to apply his mind properly to the facts is not therefore a complaint which will found judicial review. I should add that the details of this complaint which are to be seen in his affidavits do not persuade me that his complaints have any substance. The magistrate, if I may say so, appears to have applied himself properly to the resolution of this difficult case. <br />18.&nbsp;Next, it is said that Mr Theunissen was denied the right to call a witness. This complaint also is without substance at many levels. </p>\r\n<p>19.&nbsp;First, it is factually incorrect. Mr Theunissen was told before the luncheon adjournment at the hearing in the Magistrates’ Court that he must have his witness in court at 2 p.m. When at that time the witness was not present, he asked that the case be stood down to 3 p.m. or 3.30 p.m. for the convenience of the witness. The magistrate refused, as he was entitled to. Mr Theunissen then closed his case. He was not denied the opportunity to call the witness. </p>\r\n<p>20.&nbsp;Second, the evidence which the witness was to give was not, as things turned out, of any significance. Mr Villaseca did not deny that he signed the contract. It is true that he denied that the terms on the reverse were explained to him in his native language by the witness, but this may not have availed him, having regard to the decision of the High Court in Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd[2]. </p>\r\n<p>21.&nbsp;In any event, His Honour did not decide the case on the basis that Mr Villaseca was not bound by the terms of a contract which he had not read or understood. </p>\r\n<p>22.&nbsp;The third complaint, which may be seen as one as to procedure, was that Mr Theunissen was denied the right to make a final address. The magistrate made it clear on more than one occasion that he would hear Mr Theunissen on any matter of law. The magistrate was entitled to refuse to hear submissions on the evidence, which in fact was short and of narrow compass. It follows then that Mr Theunissen’s complaints are without substance. </p>\r\n<p>23.&nbsp;I pass now to the legal issues. The first depended upon the admitted fact that Mr Theunissen was not a registered tax agent. This means that while he is entitled to prepare or lodge a return or other tax document, to give advice on a taxation matter or to deal with the Australian Tax Office, he is prohibited by the Income Tax Assessment Act sub-s251L(1) and (5), from demanding or receiving payment for so doing or from suing for such a fee. </p>\r\n<p>24.&nbsp;It was contended on behalf of Mr Villaseca that this is what Mr Theunissen was doing in his demand for payment and in his Magistrates’ Court claim. Mr Theunissen challenged this, drawing attention to the terms of the contract, including those which I have summarised above. He said that he was providing tax services for no charge but that he was charging for his accounting services. </p>\r\n<p>25.&nbsp;This was a large part of the dispute before the magistrate. It should be noted that what Mr Theunissen in fact did for his client and what he was paid for is largely a factual dispute which lies in the hands of the magistrate. It cannot be challenged on review, or indeed upon appeal. It seems to me that there was evidence upon which the magistrate could have found that the statements in the contract were a mere sham; that Mr Theunissen was in fact providing tax services and charging for them at the monthly fee of $82.50. This finding would bring about the dismissal of the claim. </p>\r\n<p>26.&nbsp;Next is the finding that clause 3 of the contract, the acceleration provision, is void as a penalty. It is in these terms, and I set the term out in full: </p>\r\n<p>“Std Accounting agrees and undertakes to perform the ordered work in not more than 14 days from the date upon which the last information/details required from The Client was provided by The Client, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by both parties. Provided that all the necessary details and documentation required by Std Accounting for the purpose has been provided. The Client will provide all such information as is required by Std Accounting within 48 hours of it being requested in order to properly perform and complete its accounting function as per this Order. Failing which Std Accounting reserves the right to cease work until such information is forthcoming and the balance of the fees for the Tax Year will become payable immediately. In this regard any documentation which requires to be collected by Std Accounting in order to complete the work will attract a fee of $80 per hour and a minimum charge of $50 per trip.” </p>\r\n<p>27.&nbsp;Broadly speaking, the question is whether, viewed from the date of the contract, the contractual consequence of a breach by one party exceeds the loss which the innocent party might suffer. In the present case the contract provides for a monthly fee of $82.50. For the purposes of considering this agreement, I assume, contrary to my conclusion, that this was for accounting, that is, for non-taxation, services only. The contract creates a breach where the client fails to provide certain information necessary for the provision of the accounting services. In this event two things occur: first, the accountant may cease work; and second, the balance of fees for the year become immediately payable. This is the acceleration provision to which I have referred. </p>\r\n<p>28.&nbsp;As to the operation of the acceleration provision, it should be noted that its impact will depend upon the date of its breach, not the severity of the breach. If it occurs in May, then only one instalment is accelerated; the work done over the preceding 10 months has been paid for. If, as here, it occurs towards the beginning of the year its impact is greater for a year’s payments must be made for no services for the ensuing 10 months. This impact bears no relationship otherwise to the severity of the breach. </p>\r\n<p>29.&nbsp;The submission put on behalf of Mr Villaseca, which the magistrate upheld, was that the accelerated sum is payable even if there be no loss caused by the breach. If the breach occurs no work has to be done and no costs or time for this are expended. This may not be strictly correct, as Mr Theunissen observed, for capital costs are not work related. Nevertheless, it was in my view open to the magistrate to treat this clause as a penalty and I find no fault in his conclusion. </p>\r\n<p>30.&nbsp;The third reason, which his Honour mentions in passing, is that no breach of contract had been established. I am of course aware that Mr Theunissen gave evidence that his client did fail to provide the requested documentation. It does not appear from the transcript that Mr Villaseca contradicted this. In these circumstances I am not sure that the finding can be supported but in any event it would not affect the result. </p>\r\n<p>31.&nbsp;I conclude therefore that the application for judicial review should be dismissed. <br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br />[1] Kuek v Victoria Legal Aid (2001) 3 VR 289 <br />[2] (2004) 211 ALR 342</p>\r\n<p>APPEARANCES: The Plaintiff Theunissen appeared in person.
